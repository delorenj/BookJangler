Introduction: How to Get Clients, Make Bank, and Still Have a
Life

“An entrepreneur is someone who will jump off a cliff and assemble an airplan
on the way down.” - Reid Hoffman

Welcome to the Danger Zone

Let’s face it—every genius is just a touch crazy. Not the padded-room kind, but the
good kind of crazy. The kind that stands on the edge of a cliff takes a deep breath a
swan-dives off like an unhinged mad scientist armed with duct tape and sheer
audacity, frantically building a plane mid-freefall. (And nope, no backup

wingsuit— because that’s for people who pian instead of act.)

The entrepreneurial journey is bold, chaotic, and gloriously unpredictable—a
high-stakes adventure where the fearless thrive. That’s why the original cover of this
book features an antique fighter plane blueprint, a timeless symbol of ingenuity and
precision. Because building a business isn’t just daring—it’s a rocket-fueled,
hair-on-fire kind of wild ride. While others scramble to stitch together parachutes
mid-fall, | didn’t just build a plane—| engineered a 7-Figure Formula designed to cut

through turbulence like Maverick blazing past the sound barrier on full afterburners.
Buckle up.

This isn’t some boring “How-To” guide. It’s a turbocharged Danger Zone map for the
bold and the brave. Why a Spitfire fighter plane? Because even in a world of Al and

drones, humans still own the cockpit— observing, orienting, deciding, acting—the
Maverick. And yeah, at mid-forties, | am Tom Cruise in Top Gun—old-school grit fus
with new-school tools, still buzzing the tower just because | can.

But here’s the deal: while the world’s gone all-in on autopilot, this book is about
flipping those switches off. Tech might crunch numbers, but it can’t match the raw ¢
it takes to seize the moment, take the lead, and break formation when it counts. In @
dogfight—or a sales call—it’s still human instinct that beats every supercomputer or
the planet. And this book? It’s your flight school. |’ll take your raw talent, hone it like
jet engine, and turn you into the ace of your industry—a conversation-creating mact
that leaves your competitors sputtering on the runway.

Why This Matters

Four hundred million small businesses exist worldwide for a reason: people are done
being told they’re “Goose” when they know they’re Maverick. They’re sick of the gril
done with taking orders, and over letting someone else call the shots. It’s time to bre
free, buzz the tower, and take control—because building wealth on your terms beat:
punching someone else’s clock any day.

But let’s be real—going solo isn’t all barrel rolls and afterburners. You'll have to dod
doubters faster than a MiG at Mach 2 and survive the grilling of a drill instructor
barking, “Do you even belong in this cockpit?” right before ordering you to do push
ups until you’re questioning every life choice that got you here.

That’s why this book exists. It’s not fluff, hype, or some wannabe wingman’s pep tal
It’s a battle-tested playbook to help you take the controls and build your dream life
now —not in some “one-day” fantasy.

Steve Chandler said it best: “Your bank account directly reflects your level of
SERVICE.” And here’s the truth that'll hit you harder than a G-force pull: only 5% of
coaches hit seven figures, and less than 1% crack $1.5 million. | didn’t just make it i
that club—I flew in, flipped on the afterburners, and left vapor trails, not with cheap
hacks or TikTok motivational memes, but by redefining what it means to be elite in a
sky crowded with “just okay” coaches.

Let’s Be Real

If you’re chasing passive income fantasies, this book will feel like realizing your
autopilot’s broken mid-dogfight. “Set it and forget it” isn’t a business plan; it’s ejecti
before takeoff. This journey is about grit, sweat, and mastering the moves that make
clients need to work with you.

You know the line: “I feel the need—the need for speed!” That’s the mindset. Two hc
a day of fanatical prospecting—every single day—is all it takes to go from dreaming
the hangar to flying above the clouds.

So, if you’re ready to ditch the excuses, grab the controls, and leave the doubters
choking on your jet wash, let’s get started. This isn’t just about winning—it’s about
becoming the Top Gun of your industry. The stakes are high; the tower’s given us
clearance, and it’s time to light the fires and kick the tires.

And if you’re wondering whether I’ve got the credentials to back it up, let me drop tt
nugget on you: I’ve personally shared the stage with Kenny Loggins. Yes, that Kenn:
Loggins. Truth is stranger than fiction, my friend. But if | can survive the actual Dang
Zone, | promise you’re in good hands. Let's fly.

The Unlikely Birth of a Million-Dollar Coach

My first client? None other than a Mark Wahlberg venture. At 40, | dove headfirst int
the coaching game. First few months? Brutal. After four months and countless hour:

I'd scraped together a measly $9K. It was grind mode on steroids, and | was

questioning everything. Then, my friend Lui from Down Under hit me with some
Aussie-flavored reality: “You'll make millions doing this.” Sounded nuts. Fast-forwarc
five years, and I’m among the top 1% of coaches worldwide. How? Not by fairy dus
but by transforming my mindset and 10X action that rewired my reality.

You’re serving up business breakthroughs like a Michelin-star chef, and your
clients can’t get enough of the secret sauce.

You've ditched your 9-5 like a bad one-night stand and are living it up—worki

This book is the golden goose if you are a coach, consultant, advisor, speaker,

we could put you in the witness protection program, change your name, and drop y:
off in Milwaukee, Wisconsin (“Undercover Coach” coming to a streaming service ne
you!). Within six months, you'd earn $250K/yr with your eyes closed, applying these
simple, counter-intuitive techniques.

Coaching is not about your CV, MBA, how many exits you have, or any other vanity
metrics. It's a game of reverse psychology and relationship dynamics, and it's alway
and only based on the actual results your potential clients believe you can bring to
them, based on how you’ve served others who will advocate for you.

As Dale Carnegie once said, “To be interesting, be interested.”

The only greater mystery than “how do | get unlimited clients” is “how do | create a
breakthrough on every first call?” Once | cracked this, | emotionally closed 100% of
clients (Step 1). With their buy-in secured, helping them from the same side of the té

respect, with the additional benefit that partners, siblings, and business partners wil
ALSO turn into clients. Lemons into lemonade. Lesson #118 JMM!

A note from a mentor, the living legend Charles H. Green, who co-wrote The Trustea
Advisor:

“My first 20 years of consulting taught me that problem definition is about 10X more
valuable than problem solution. It ensures you're solving the right problem. It took m
20 years of consulting to learn that a shared problem definition is about 20 times mo
valuable than successfully defining it independently.

Solo problem definition is an exercise in mental masturbation. Rarely have | seen a
client de novo convinced of a problem definition solely by my brilliant exposition. Ha
seen a client buy a definition/solution that doesn't link to some deeply held viewpoin
value, or belief that the client already has?

The conclusion: from the first interaction, sit on the same side of the metaphorical
table. Mutually admit ignorance and commit to a genuinely collaborative search for t.
correct problem definition; skip all the credentialing and demonstrations of your
experience and intellect, roll up your sleeves, and work with your new
partner-in-training. The rest takes care of itself.”

The coaching industry is growing alarmingly, but only among the top 1% of prospec
with resources. For the 99%, coaching has fallen on the priority list. It’s a sad state «
global affairs, but you’re not reading this book to storm the White House; you’re
looking to maximize your earnings immediately. ;-)

Once you’ve mastered the essentials, go deep into the writings of Alan Weiss and
David C. Baker, who do $5MM+ per year solo. I’ve studied them both and
deconstructed their playbooks into “first principles” to put my unique spin on how a
coaches can land high-fee clients.

Everybody else hits around 1MM top line and kills their cash flow with low ticket
courses, staffing up with full-time equivalents (FTEs), and delegation. You won't. I'll
teach you to earn $500-2K/hr solo by talking, 100% pure profit. Nobody wants to hil

“Become a millionaire not for the million dollars, but for what it will make of ya

The trick to this business is that you have to love doing it. You must fall in love with
every aspect of the process, not just the coaching delivery and fulfillment side but
especially the lost art of net new client acquisition.

Especially prospecting —don’t even call it that anymore. Think of it as “talking to qué
humans” or simply “talking to people all day.” In the same way, we’ve redefined clos
as “enrolling.” Those old terms carry too much baggage— pain, rejection, and drudg
nstead, start each day with an open heart and mind, ready to chop wood and carry
water.

To build a full, thriving practice, you may initially spend up to 80% of your time
prospecting—so it’s essential to reframe it as something you genuinely enjoy.

Cultivating this mindset fuels the stamina you need to persevere. Remember, it’s a

marathon, not a sprint until you secure those first 5 to 15 clients.

Don’t let negativity wear you down. Many people—colleagues, competitors, and eve
strangers—will respond with jealousy, bitterness, and even hostility. Let it slide. You

Here’s a secret weapon against self-doubt that works every time: grab a blank page
and draw a timeline. Start with your birth date. Next, add your first steps into the
workforce, your proudest professional moments, and any year you courageously
endured an annual performance review. Watch your story unfold!

Now think about the people who chose you—those who hired you, invested in you,
at least didn’t run the other way. This isn’t just a timeline; it’s proof that you’ve been
conquering self-doubt since you figured out how to get dressed in the morning. Eve
step led you here; self-doubt is toast, and you’ve got the timeline to prove it.

If you have a job, congratulations! Two things are true: (1) You’ve got some skills, an

minds. That’s why asking your closest 5 to 15 people about your “expertise” is so
powerful, as David C. Baker points out in The Business of Expertise. It’s a bit like
having a superpower you didn’t realize, except without the need for a cape (unless
that’s your style).

When I’m coaching coaches, consultants, advisors, or anyone else trying to break o
of the imposter-syndrome rut, the biggest hurdle is the comparison game: “I didn’t
have five exits,” they say, or “I wasn’t the top rep at Oracle or Salesforce.” Listen,
clients don’t care about your vanity metrics. They’re not hiring you because of some
impressive LinkedIn numbers; they’re hiring you because you know something they
don’t. And if that isn’t a power move, | don’t know what is. ;-)

Why they
pay you

What obstacles stand between your client and their dream—the ones you’re here to
help them overcome?

Your results are your calling card. If you're just starting your business, leverage the F
Circle process from Steve Chandler and Rich Litvin to get initial testimonials and ca:
studies from people you already know that you can promote and leverage to get the
flywheel of client acquisition turning. My clients are always my best salespeople anc
referral sources.

You must drive testimonials and social proof from the beginning of the 3-Wall
JMM Model.

If nothing in this book works for you, the problem is probably your testimonials—the
lack punch. People want results they can see, hear, and measure. Start small if you

have to: free or low-fee clients can give you the jaw-dropping success stories you n
to charge big bucks.

Whether you’re a mindset coach, conflict whisperer, manifestation wizard, or one of
other flavors of guru, remember: people pay big for proof. Make your testimonials
scream results, and your clients will sell you better than you ever could.

“Don’t take my word for it; talk to my clients.” (bold solution to everything!)

Just trust me here: skipping this step has led to clients struggling for many more
months than needed. If you have the bedrock of raving clients, you’ll create
unshakeable champions pushing through the direct messages (DMs), the discovery
call, into the negotiation, and close. Clients who feel your self-belief and extreme be
in them will see an ROI.

Any ambivalence or wishy-washiness here, and they just won’t be able to trust you
enough to pay you. That’s the chronic “I need to think about it” or when the client te

people can not only afford your fee but are in the buying window; you’re just not
confident you can help them. Sales is the transference of belief.

Finding Great Clients & The Two Closes

As | mentioned, every coaching call has two moments of truth: The "emotional close
and the "money close." People love to buy but hate to be so/d. My secret sauce? | c
clients so emotionally invested they’re practically lighting candles in my honor. They
see value, hear angels sing, and feel an undeniable urge to work with me. It’s like a
primal need, somewhere between a crush and a revelation.

Sales Superpowers (shoot me a message, and I'll share the goods). Every coach ha:
hustle for themselves, so | dedicated a whole chapter to this art of the hunt.

I’ve talked to the heavyweights in this game. Sure, they'll have the occasional VA, SI
or appointment setter (and believe me, I’ve tried them all—from Denmark to Delhi). §
here’s the kicker: top earners like Rich Habets, Ankush Jain, Carolyn Freyer-Jones,
Steve Hardison, Melissa Ford, Karen Davis, Townsend Wardlaw, and Scott Leese kn
that real magic happens when they’re the ones reaching out—no bots, no recycled
scripts—just raw, human-to-human connection, like the troglodytes of high-ticket
sales.

Here’s how to nail my 2-hour daily prospecting routine and have fun doing it:

Block out two 45-minute sessions: You can’t “Always Be Prospecting” (ABI
you're “Always Being Distracted.” Treat this time like it’s sacred—if Mark Cub.
called, you’d tell him, “Sorry, I’m prospecting.”

Fix your LinkedIn feed: Hit “follow” 200+ times on perfect targets like Black
Friday. When you’re done, your feed will be rich with leads instead of your
cousin’s vacation photos. (VPs and CXOs with 7+ years’ experience scream
“$3K+/mo client,” so focus there.)

Use tools for a curated feed: Al-powered automation and analytics turn you
feed into a magic show—poof, prospects appear out of nowhere! Sales Nav
tries, but it’s more like sawing yourself in half—effective, sure, but who has th
energy?

Only talk to people you like. Yogi Berra's wisdom is, “Only close clients whc
can afford your fee.” Translation? There are no window shoppers, no “I'll think
about it” types, and no one whose profile screams “still splitting Wi-Fi with th
neighbors.”

Put on a vibe soundtrack: Sacred frequencies like 432 Hz or 528 Hz are
excellent for spiritual and financial alignment. Not your thing? Go for Taylor
Swift, a podcast, or whatever gets you hyped to close deals.

Stop being a perfectionist: Just show up and DM people. Use The 4th Fram
and 7-Step Close Process™ like a Swiss Army knife—it doesn’t matter if you
don’t know all the functions; just start cutting. Remember Guy Kawasaki’s
advice: “Don’t worry, be crappy.”

Get chatty with a 2:1 ratio: They should reply twice for every message you
send. How? Ask provocative questions like:

## Page 29

leadership, and where you lead, they’ll follow. Seal the deal with, “I'll send a
simple invoice for $XK/mo. Once the transfer’s done, we’re good to go. It has
credit and e-check options.” They'll jump out of the plane like The Flying Elvis
before you say, “Deal closed.”

Pro Tip: Stalk smarter. Nearly every LinkedIn first-degree connection has an
email hidden under “Contact Info.” Click it, grab it, and use it. Voila—your
omnichannel follow-up just got easier.

Now, crush those sessions and make it rain.

Hit them with a mix of video drops, voice notes, and the occasional GIF barrage—ju
enough to keep them guessing and you memorable. I’ve got a whole army of prospe
who received 20+ messages from me with crickets in response. And yet, sometimes
message 21 is the tipping point. Persistence pays off, but only if you keep it spicy—
a plot twist in Billions, not Gossip Girl. Toss in a Venn diagram, a killer quote, or a ca
study. Keep them hooked like it’s the finale, not a rerun.

Touch one: drop a cheeky “spark” one-liner. Touch two: follow up with a cat GIF (wr
can resist?). Touch three: share a use case that’ll have them thinking, “Ouch, that’s
me.” (JMM 1.0 and Codex 9-11 explain this in glorious detail.)

And yes, the top reply | get on LinkedIn is, “Are you a bot?” My response? “If | had z
bot this smooth, I’d be a billionaire by now!” ;-)

Brian Burns said best: “What is not overtly positive is covertly negative.” So, if you’r
getting ghosted on a cold thread, don’t sweat it; it’s static. But if they go MIA after a
first call, that’s a red flag. When that happens, throw a friendly nudge: “What’s comi
up for you since we last met?”

Or return to the last “hook point” (shoutout to Neil Strauss), where they got honest
about their goals or limiting beliefs: “Il was just thinking about your goal to hit seven
figures. | have some thoughts on how to make it more achievable.” GIF bumps are fi
but you’ve got to put some meat on that bone.

And here’s my #1 tip: SLOW the F DOWN. Be the world’s happiest garden snail.

Slow down, observe, and research. There are no more one-size-fits-all “spark”
openers. Be human; think like your prospect. Dive into their recent activity, look for :
opening, and add value where it matters.

Go wide on LinkedIn with plenty of “sparks” (light, witty, SMS-style messages to
1st-degree connections) and “spears” (sharp, social-proof-packed InMails for
2nd-degree connections). Think of it like Crocodile Dundee fishing with dynamite at
top of the funnel—100 a day? Perfectly fine. But the moment someone bites, kill you
automation like it’s a bad first date, take a deep breath, and start a real conversatior
Ask them what they’re aiming for, what drives them, what they’ve tried, and what’s
holding them back. Then, reel it in with a Zoom invite. Hook, line, and booked!

This “7-step” rhythm pops up all over this manual because, like gravity yanking an
apple off a tree, the psychology of DMs is universal. Since cracking this formula, I’ve
pulled thousands of chats onto Zoom—even with CROs who probably started the ci
wondering why they agreed to it in the first place.

And remember: GIFs are cute, but knowing when to send one? That’s the actual art.

Look:

“Since working with Justin, my team has made a 180% increase in closed

2. Invitations: How many people did you invite to a coaching conversation?

3. Coaching Experiences: How many people did you coach - who are not current

4. No's: How many no's did you collect?

5. Proposals: How much money did you request?”

Chapter 3: Starting Strong: Get Clients Early, Fly Under the Rac

People come to me daily, wanting to escape the 9-to-5 grind and launch their own
coaching or consulting biz, but they’re stumped on finding that first client. My
philosophy? Clients are everywhere. Out of 2.3 billion adults on this planet, 11 millio
are in sales, and 400 million are small business owners. They are legion; you are...w

The pie keeps growing; statistically, you’ve got more clients than you could ever

3) Reach out to them with a lateral referral ask that sounds unassuming like this
“Hey Jane, I’m starting to do some coaching on the side; maybe that applies
you. Who do you know?”

your inbox with, “Hey, could you help me?” Or, even better, they’ll refer you to other

Second Circle & Advanced Sales Navigator Tactics

100% of your new business comes from your views. That’s right—your profile vie
are a goldmine, so mine every single one of them like you’re digging for diamonds ir
Minecraft. Add and message all the relevant people. That’s the jackpot.

Step 1: Watch your profile views like a hawk on too much coffee.

Step 2: Respond immediately, as your life depends on it.

Step 3: Be blunt, bold, and a little provocative in your outreach—not desperate. You

Mining your first —and second-degree connections is like having X-ray vision for
networking. Look for nodes—like Scott Leese and me, who are connected to 30,00(

people and probably know every thought leader, influencer, and cool kid in your spe
Nodes are power hubs. Find them and use them.

Pro Tip: Mine everyone who likes, comments on your posts, views your profile, or
follows you. I’ve gotten so much business from lurkers who never even engaged
publicly. Views are business. Period.

Want to turbocharge? Commenting beats posting. Find a post where your prospect:
are hanging out, leave a comment acknowledging and provoking, and then reply to 1
other comments below yours. Do this 10 times a day, and voila—you’ve created a
snowball that’ll eventually turn into an inbound avalanche.

Fun fact: Most people lurk like double agents—they love your book, webinar, or offe
but won’t engage. Why? Because your competitor isn’t another coach or
consultant—it’s “do nothing” (shoutout to Tony J. Hughes). People default to the sta
quo. Your job? Nudge them out of it.

Want scale? Use Sales Navigator like a pro:

- LinkedIn 1st-degree messages: 50/day. Copy. Paste. Pray.

- InMails: 50/month.

- Open Profile InMails: 800/month (thank you, loopholes).

- Test your messaging on Open Profiles and use the green dot to see who's online (|
digital stalking, but make it business-friendly).

- Use all your monthly InMails—it’s not rollover data; if you don’t use it, you lose it. |
blow through mine by the 16th and frequently uncover $50,000 in hidden deals.

Pro-level LinkedIn hacks:

- Filter 2nd-degree connections through nodes like Josh Braun. With ~400 mutual
connections, you look like a rockstar with clout.

- Sort searches by “posted on LinkedIn” and exclude “People you interacted with” t
avoid repeat mistakes.

- Save this search, rinse, repeat.

Oh, and don’t underestimate the blank connection request. Mystery is sexy. If your
profile’s new, though, maybe tailor it just a smidge. ;-)

Every missed profile view, unmined connection, and unused InMail is leaving money
the table. The opportunity cost is massive. The reward is bigger than your Bitcoin
wallet after 2013.

Sales Navigator Spears (Outbound)

Key distinction: Use “sparks” for first-degree connections—short, engaging chat flo
that assume familiarity and spark instant rapport. For second-degree connections,
adopt a “spear” approach inspired by JMM™ cold emails, leveraging variable subje
lines (see JMM 1.0 for reference). Experiment with ultra-short InMails, exploring a ra
of strategies—from bold, direct asks to softer, lateral, and indirect approaches acros
both channels.

Generally, the first degree works more like a soft sell chat.

When it comes to InMail (2nd degree), you’ve got one shot—so make it count. The k
heuristics | rely on are quantified social proof, brevity, and emotional resonance root
in pain or fear. A strong InMail starts with a compelling case study highlighting clear
ROI with concrete proof points. (Check out real examples of high-impact InMail spe:
below!)

Heuristics are powerful shortcuts—formulas, and frameworks that form the foundati
of the most effective templates. Think of them as the "meta" of strategic linguistics.

Stealth Hustle—Success Under the Radar

“THE SEX & CASH THEORY - The creative person basically has two kinds of jobs: C
is the sexy, creative kind. Second is the kind that pays the bills. Sometimes the task .
hand covers both bases, but not often.” - Hugh MacLeod

If you’re a coach or consultant struggling to gain traction, here’s the unfiltered truth:
a side gig or even a full-on job. Why? Because when you’re not sweating bullets to
close every client like it’s the last donut on earth, you suddenly exude this fabulous,
calm confidence clients can practically smell. With a steady paycheck, the desperat
need this sale” vibes evaporate. Instead, you’re coaching from a place of zen, not
caffeine-fueled survival mode.

Think of it like this:

1) Got a corporate job? Use that salary as a cushion, and let your side hustle breath
2) Side hustle sinking? Add a corporate gig to lower the stakes and make life (and
clients) bearable.

During my last VP of Sales stint at a tech company, | nailed my work in the usual 5-7
hours a day and still had enough bandwidth to coach, advise, and throw in some
motivational speeches (no, they didn’t ask). | didn’t slap “executive coach” or “sales

“Subject Matter Expert” in your headline as long as you're not too obvious about
moonlighting as the next Tony Robbins.

The key is to get creative with the job title—think “specialist,” “process guru,”
“facilitator,” “mentor,” or “problem solver.” It’s all about striking that balance where
you're undercover enough to keep HR happy but bold enough to make your DM gar
strong. Then, subtly align this mysterious yet impressive title with your messaging.

Before you know it, you’re living the double life with style.

Pro Tip: Let’s talk about the word “coach.” People claim to hate it—but let’s be real;
they also hate cold calls and still pick up the phone. Here’s the deal: If 1°
people in a red ocean, “Would you like some coaching, consulting, or training?” you
get 1,000 “no thanks” responses faster than you can say, “Hard pass!” That’s not
coaching—that’s clerking.

But here’s why | still leave “executive coach” in my headline: it sets the frame. They
me as the coach and themselves as the client. This avoids role reversal, where
suddenly they’re coaching you—a disaster for authority. If that happens, flip it back
an Aikido master and keep the coaching frame intact. (Shoutout to Litvin and Chanc
for that gem.)

Fun fact: You can fully engage someone without ever saying the word “coach.” Foct
on their goals, problems, opportunities, and what’s holding them back. When | slide
into the DMs with, “Would you like some help with that?” they know I’m offering
coaching; there's no need to say it. But if | just call myself “Advisor”? That’s when |:
“What’s up? How can | help you?” Stick with “coach” —you'll attract warmer, more
ready-to-buy prospects.

Of course, test it. A/B your headlines to see which generates less role reversal and
better lead quality.

Side Hustle Survival:

If you’re building a coaching biz while working for a company, tread carefully. Some

firms don’t like reps dabbling in training, courses, or consulting and might slap your
wrist (or worse). They think your intellectual property (IP) belongs to them, even if it’s

deep. Look for sketchy clauses like IP assignments or confidentiality agreements thi

Here’s your goal: carve out the IP you create on your own time. Document timelines
keep it off company devices, and make sure you own your frameworks. It’s your rigt

If all goes smoothly, you'll pick up a few clients for $2.5K/month. Remember,
$5K/month is $60K/year, just from a side hustle. Add that to your full-time gig, and
boom—you’re printing money.

Russian Doll Hustle

The Matryoshka, or Russian nesting doll, metaphor explains precisely how to monet
your skills. One doll fits inside another: Who is your client? Start with yourself. If you
were a rep, you would coach reps. If you led teams, you would coach team leaders
run workshops. Layer by layer, you would monetize your skills like the blades on a
Gillette razor.

Here’s my Theory of Everything:

1. Who is Sarah?

2. What are Sarah’s skills?

3. What was Sarah’s journey in building those skills?

Sarah finds more “Sarahs” and accelerates them on their path. That’s the magic: yo!
coaching is a microcosm of your skills, story, and accomplishments.

How to Monetize Your Role Today:

Think of your current job as a sales pipeline for your coaching business. Whatever
you're doing now, that’s what you coach.

- Leading a sales team? Coach clients on creating pipelines, closing deals, and
strategizing more effectively.

- Full-cycle sales? Package enablement programs for AEs.

## Page 43

- Running a top-of-funnel team? Advise SDR leaders and target Heads of Demand (¢
or Sales Enablement.

It’s all about moving the right metrics:

- Create Pipeline

- Push deal flow to 3-5X the target ($10M pipeline at 20% close rate = $2M
closed-won)

- Speed up deal velocity

- Increase ACV (Annual Contract Value) or TC (Total Contract Value)

That’s your diamond—polish it and start cashing in.

1. What You Love - The things that spark joy and excitement.

2. What the World Needs — Your contribution to society and positive impact.
3. What You Can Be Paid For — How you earn a living.

4. What You Are Good At - Your skills and unique talents.

Where two circles intersect, a deeper layer of insight emerges:

- Passion = What You Love + What You Are Good At

- Mission = What You Love + What the World Needs

- Profession = What You Are Good At + What You Can Be Paid For
- Vocation = What the World Needs + What You Can Be Paid For

At the center of these circles lies your Ikigai—the culmination of all four dimensions
This is your being in its purest form. It's why you leap out of bed each morning and
stay committed until you’ve seen your work through.

Alignment requires ongoing refinement, especially as you progress through life’s
stages. Neglecting one or more areas creates an imbalance. You may end the day
feeling busy yet unfulfilled, sensing that you are missing something vital. Miss two o
more, and you may feel a nagging anxiety, an inner reminder that you’re not fully
aligned with your purpose.

Take time to fill in these circles with specifics. For example:

- What You Love - Perhaps you love guiding people to become better leaders and
using music to enhance their well-being.

- What You Are Good At - Your strengths could be leadership coaching and music
production.

- What the World Needs - Mentally resilient, emotionally intelligent leaders are
essential.

- What You Can Be Paid For — Executive coaching programs integrating music for
stress reduction and mental clarity.

When these circles intersect, you discover new layers:

## Page 46

7-Figu.. * © © (© .) 3

- Passion — You merge your love for leadership with your music talent, creating an

experience that enhances clarity and well-being.

- Mission — Your goal is to develop emotionally grounded leaders through music-ba
coaching.

- Vocation — Providing leadership coaching supported by music therapy to help
leaders thrive emotionally.

- Profession — Offering paid programs where leadership meets music for mental cla
and stress relief.

This is how Ikigai defines you. You’re not just a coach or a music producer; you’re a
unique blend—a guide for leaders who tap into the power of music to create balanc
and resilience. This alignment doesn’t just clarify your purpose; it becomes a practic
filter for your work, highlighting where adjustments might be needed to stay true to
your core being.

The Japanese are a trip—in the best way possible. They’ve got this thing called
Kintsugi, which is basically the art of taking broken stuff and gluing it back together

Tips for High Hourly Earnings and Work-Life Balance (With Extra Zest)

1.

Never Work by the Hour—It’s Unethical (and Kinda Dumb).

Alan Weiss said it best: if you pay me by the hour, I’m incentivized to stretch:
the clock like a soap opera finale. Want me at $2,000/hr while | take 50 hours
solve a 5-hour problem? Sure, it sounds great—for me. Instead, let’s focus o1
ROI and results. Case in point: if I’m paid $5,000 monthly for eight 30-minute
sessions (4 hours total), that’s $1,250/hr on paper. I’ll even “burn” it down to

$500/hr to over-deliver. | might toss in a surprise 1:1 just for kicks. But the ke
here is always protecting your hourly calculus like it’s the last slice of deep-di
pizza.

. Block Nights and Weekends.

Going full cowboy, coaching 24/7, sounds cool—until it doesn’t, and you're
crying into your third coffee at 2 a.m., Googling “signs of burnout.” Take
weekends off to hang with your family, rank nationally at Pickleball, or just ste
at your crypto balance. Bonus points if you're resting, reading Nietzsche, and
plotting world domination on your days off.

. Exercise = Sanity.

The holy trinity: 10,000 steps, lifting heavy things, and not eating like a wise ¢
after a prison break. Exercise saves you from becoming that jittery,
over-caffeinated coach who “just loves the grind.” Pun intended! Speaking of
caffeine...

Here’s the secret: close fewer clients, but treat them like you’re their personal
DJ. What tracks (or insights) can you drop to get them hyped? How can you
remix their strategy to blow their minds? If you’ve got 10-25 clients, keep a
playlist and spin new ways to crank up their results daily. Be their DJ
Khaled—always another one.

And stop hogging the mic. Coaches who shut up and listen—like therapists v

don’t charge by the hour—will obliterate the mansplainers. Watch Rich Litvin
100 videos and take notes like it’s your final exam.

Work smart, stay human, and remember: sometimes the best breakthroughs happe!
when you’re barefoot in the woods or deep into your Sth cat video of the day.
Productivity? Overrated. Cat memes? Timeless.

Speaking of random segues, let’s talk about the magic of green—my favorite color
(totally not biased by my eyes or my wallet). Ever notice how hanging around trees,
grass, or even that sad houseplant clinging to life instantly chills you out? That’s
because green is basically nature’s Prozac. Science says it lowers stress, cranks up
zen, and works faster than doom-scrolling Twitter during a meltdown.

Our ancestors hardwired us to love green because it screamed, “Hey, food! Water! t
hungry tigers!” Even looking at plants tricks your brain into thinking, “We’re safe. Ch
out.” That’s why hospitals paint walls green—it’s not for the decor vibes, it’s for the
don’t freak out vibes.

And green doesn’t just calm you; it makes you sharper. Ever hit a mental brick wall,

then take a walk and suddenly channel Einstein? That’s green spaces decluttering y
brain, like Marie Kondo, but for your thoughts. It’s a reset button for your
mind—Ctrl+Alt+Delete, but make it leafy.

You don’t need a rainforest to feel the magic. A desk plant, a window view, or even i
budget-friendly nature screensaver can turn your workspace from a “stress pit” to a
“zen oasis.” So, get a plant (yes, fake counts), hug a tree, or give your lawn some lo’
eye contact. Green: the life hack your soul’s been waiting for.

speed read $700M Offers, and...crickets. “Curse you, Alex Hormozi!” you shout intc
the universe. ;-) But no one's biting on your coaching offer. Why? Because the
coaching industry is packed to the brim— 10,000 trainers, gurus, experts, and folks
with too many LinkedIn posts clawing for attention. Welcome to the ultimate red oce

But here’s the kicker: there is a way to stand out from the noise. Enter The 4th Fram
Everyone keeps asking me for the advanced version and better openers. Well, buck
up—because I’m finally spilling the goods right here.

Fourth Frame (Advanced Training)

History lesson:
1. Sell a product
2. Sell time
3. Sell ROUTE (Matrixed)
4. Converse (sell by chat!)

Technique: You stay focused on
1. The problem/opportunity
2. Curious about their world / their profile
3. Injecting yourself into the solution toward that future state

And just fixate on 1 and 2 back-to-back until they crack and the polarity shifts. Ther
no rocket science here. It's an elemental detective, doctor, and therapist archetype :
entirely removes showing off.

The Polarity Shift is the holy grail of selling. It’s the precise moment when your idea
moves to their idea—that subtle moment when desire jumps the shark (or the couck
Tom Cruise!)

“We must create the desire in the prospect.” — Garrett “GMAC” MacDonald

But does the 4th frame work? Let’s ask Luke Shalom:

“Since we worked together, | used JMM to scale my business from $2K p/m to $25k

p/m in § months. | closed $172k in my first year in business, blowing my expectation

out of the water. The numbers don't lie. | would have paid 10X the investment for ho
much of an impact working with JM had on my life, confidence, and business.”

Wall Two. Nobody has any money.

“I'll have to think about it” —the kiss of death. It hits you like a freight train right after
you've just listened to your prospect spill their soul in DMs and had your first call wit
the patience of a monk. You sit there, pretending to be calm and heart-centered, wh
your world crumbles into a thousand tiny shards, like a baby elephant on a rampage
a Ming vase shop. ;-)

But here’s the thing: we don’t crumble under pressure—we coach every client throu
their breakthrough. That cave they’re terrified to enter? The one where they finally
invest in you? Yep, that’s where the treasure’s stashed: massive success (and probe
a few emotional cobwebs). Think of it like clearing a forest for new growth—we’ve g
to air out their trauma from past dud coaching experiences, like opening the window
after your partner turns “date night mahi-mahi” into a smoke signal.

Then, we hit them with the 7-step Close Process. Suddenly, they’re chasing your fee
like they just put it all on red at the roulette table—hearts pounding, chips flying, anc
praying for a jackpot.

“People love to buy, but they hate to be sold.” - Jeffrey Gitomer

1. To increase our income

2. To increase our influence

3. To increase our impact.”

. What's holding you back?

. Case study

. Polarity shift (What does it cost?)
. Share fees tied to ROI of #1

Grab a Post-it, scribble this down, and slap it on your mirror or laptop—your shrine,
your rules. It’s not science; it’s sorcery. After a thousand tries, | figured it out, and th
same magic formula kept showing up. Let’s look at it from a different lens:

. Where are you going? (Hopefully, somewhere better than “away from here.”)

Pressure test their goal—because, shocker, it’s never about the money.

. Banish their bad coach baggage. (No holy water required.)

. Get them to admit their kryptonite—preferably without tears.

. Share your highlight reel—and your clients’ Oscar-worthy transformations.

Play it right, and this part’s on autopilot. Caution: Curiosity killed the cat—do1

bite on earlier fee questions.

. End with possibility, never affordability (Chandler/Litvin), not “Do | need to sel
my soul or audition for Magic Mike?”

Here’s the thing: always tie your fees to their dream ROI. People will happily blow $1
on crypto if they think it’ll turn into $100K overnight. Real high-performance coache:
We own the ROI! talk but don’t make promises—because we're coaches, not fortune
tellers. My line? “I guarantee my time and expertise. If you bring the hustle, I'll bring
muscle.”

Here’s your golden ticket: customization. It’s the coaching world’s “open sesame” fc
high fees. Drop it into the conversation enough, and suddenly, you’re not selling
coaching—you’re curating a bespoke, VIP-level transformation wrapped in velvet an
delivered with a side of caviar. ;-)

The First Touch—DM Openers That Work

If | had to distill my entire client acquisition method—captured across seven books,
of which bear my name—it would come down to one game-changing principle:

The INDIRECT METHOD of client creation.

Prospects are fed up with the full-frontal sales approach. It’s like hearing the same
lousy pickup line on repeat. There are a hundred ways to spark engagement, and th
possibilities become endless if you think laterally or indirectly. Start an organic
conversation fueled by genuine curiosity. Then, ease into the 4th Frame, the 7-Step,
even layer them together. This isn’t just sales—it’s a sophisticated “strictly ballroom
dance that turns interest into action without ever making the first move.

Here’s some incredible wisdom from Jonny Staker, one of my top clients who gets
savage response rates, “There’s no template for what works. The ultimate heuristic i
being your genuine, authentic self. That’s why it’s about formulas and frameworks, r

exact ‘spark’ openers. A/B test them and find out what lands and why. Riffa pi nd
limitless variations until you crack the top funnel on LinkedIn, and 80% re: pond.”

For example, in music, artists must develop their style or “sound.” Otherwise, you’re
derivative. Lenny Kravitz was critically panned and dismissed until he found his voic
on his 5th album, "5.” Don’t be a clone using hacks and blind-click funnels. Acquire
clients from the heart, the gut, and your intuition.

“Almost all potential coaching clients will show up in their first conversations
with you as their biographical self only. Their ego. And that is the very habit thi
has kept them stuck and challenged. If you can help them with that and releas
them from that unnecessary straitjacket, you will be worth all the coaching
money they can pay you.” - Steve Chandler

Openers That Pop:
- PDF + Opinion Heuristic: "Everyone has an opinion—how would you improve this

content?" (Because people /ove to critique, and let’s be real, it’s easier than creatinc
something original.)

- Thread Sparker: Ask a provocative question, “Is your sales team ready for 2025, «
are we still playing 2020 ball?” (Page 177 of Sales Superpowers, SSP JMM
1.0—required reading, folks.)

- Recruiter Mode: Slide in with, “I noticed your move to [new role]. What motivated
jump?” Instant intrigue without the weird LinkedIn job spam vibes.

- Activity Feed Goldmine: “| saw your post about Q3 challenges—how are you
planning to crush Q4?” (Specific and relevant = FIRE)

- Transposing: “Your [specific experience] reminds me of [my own experience]. Eve
face [challenge]?” Relatability level: Expert.

Examples for the Brave:

- “Don’t you think ChatGPT emails are just rep spam with a fancy hat?”
- “How’s the Ray Dalio book working out? Worth my time?”
- “What inspired the Portugal gap year? Jealous over here!”

What NOT to Do:

- Friend-Zoning Yourself: If your headline doesn’t scream “coach,” you’re just a
“LinkedIn pen pal.” Drop, “Have you ever worked with an executive coach?” and ho
the frame—because Challengers take the trophy while Relationship Builders hold th
door.

- Flattery Bombs: "Wow, congrats on the promotion and the award! Truly
groundbreaking stuff...” said literally everyone else in your inbox.

- Overuse First Names: Don’t be the guy who starts every sentence with ‘Steve.’
Unless, of course, you’re auditioning to play a chatbot in a low-budget sci-fi. The
biggest cringe? The name bump. Steve??

- Pitch Slapping: Nobody wants a cold DM that feels like a drunk pickup line at last
call—spark a conversation that actually makes them want to say yes.

Notes & Hacks:

- Metering: Regulate your chatter. Don’t hit back with a novel if their reply is ten wo
Keep it punchy and show you listen.

- Soft & Indirect Touches: “Let’s compare notes on the quarter.” “Catch me up on
your strategies.” Trojan-horse into the conversation and save the heavy artillery (7-S
Close) for the call.

- Troubleshooting: Wide-open, human-level questions win: “How’s the vibe at your
company?” “Do you even like your boss?” You are guaranteed to get at least a smirl

Autofill Hack:

- Hit the “Catch Up” tab and let LinkedIn Al sprinkle its generic magic: “Congrats on
the new role!” or “Happy belated birthday!” Fire off 50 of these daily—it’s not
personalized, but people eat up recency bias like candy. Once they reply, pivot into
framing and hit them with the good stuff.

Out-of-the-Box Genius:

Picture this: a driving event at Porsche Experience Atlanta. Add Al magic to make yc
prospects into Will Ferrell as Ricky Bobby in Talladega Nights, sending custom videc
invites. It’s fun, wild, and impossible to ignore - especially when ClOs suddenly have
full head of hair again. (Hat tip to JP Albano for showing us how to blend JMM with
Heinecke-style Contact Marketing like a pro.)

f your openers don’t feel like a mic drop, go back and tweak ‘em until they do.

Chapter 6: Sell By Chat: DM Your Way to Booked Calls

“Remember, you don't have to take yourself so seriously to do a seriously goor
job.” - Michael Neill

you'll start to smell like desperation. This is about the art of attraction, people! Bob,
weave, throw in a dash of mystery. Do you drop the truth bomb or cushion it with
empathy? My advice: channel your inner Muhammad Ali. “Float like a butterfly, stinc
like a bee.” And maybe throw in a bit of “Ghost them like Houdini.”

Want to get good at this? Start with 500 honest conversations. Yep, there's no typo
here. Dive in, swim through the awkward silences and cringe-worthy typos, and
eventually, you'll develop a sixth sense. It’s a superpower that whispers, “Now is the
time to ask for the Zoom.”

Let me blow up a myth: You don’t need a Ph.D. in brand-building or a movie trailer c
reels to get a client. All you need is one finger and a DM button. This is the Justin
Michael Method: Stop hiding behind the inbound marketing Rose Parade float.
Opportunity isn’t politely waiting in line. It’s banging on your DMs, yelling, “Why arer
you talking to me yet?!”

| know—you're itching to outsource this to some agency with a “guaranteed” lead-g
strategy. But here’s the twist: people aren’t buying a pitch; they’re buying you. | don
care if you’re a coach, a consultant, or an alpaca whisperer. Every elite coach | knov
still dives into their DMs, not just booking calls but crafting connections. They'll toss
an insight, a sprinkle of vulnerability, and leave the other person thinking, “Okay, | di
know if this is love, but | have to talk to you.”

As Maya Angelou put it, people forget what you say but never forget how you make
them feel. And that feeling is why they'll book the call and say, “Take my money.”

Here’s where it gets all Matrix-level philosophical. When you're fully present, the scr
disappears. It’s not just a DM exchange anymore; it’s two humans having a real, hor
conversation. No BS, just genuine curiosity. This is beyond selling; it’s connecting.

Want to up your game? Read The Game by Neil Strauss and Models by Mark Mans
Yes, they’re dating books, and the overlap is wild. It’s true in dating and sales:
neediness repels. If you’re coming off like you need this call to make rent, they’ll ser
it and backflip out of there. Instead of a polished, Oscar-worthy DM, just send a raw
message.

What is the biggest thing I’ve learned on this journey? Words are just the tip of the
iceberg. Beneath every DM, there’s an energy—an intent that people feel, like a vibe
The real magic happens when you’re there just to connect and give value without
strings attached. When you show up with calm confidence instead of “Oh please, le
chat,” they lean in. They feel the difference and are drawn to you—not for what you’!
saying but for why you’re saying it.

So, next time you’re typing up a DM, ask yourself: What’s my real intent here? You'v
just unlocked the cheat code when you make it about connecting, not closing.

You'll land more clients by being unapologetically real—sarcastic, funny, a little
polarizing, and playing just hard enough to get—than by coming off like the overly
eager puppy of the coaching world. No one hires the clingy “please like me!” energy
they hire the confident “you'll be lucky to work with me” vibe.

Be fearless. Speak the truth, but keep it classy, San Diego. Sometimes, that means
having a blunt-but-loving “come-to-Jesus” chat:

- “Look, maybe wine isn’t its own food group if you’re serious about fitness.”

- “You hate prospecting, never do it, and wonder why sales are slow. See the
problem?” ;-)

The goal isn’t to roast them; it’s to show you care enough to tell them what they nee
to hear, not just what they want to hear.

Nobody invests in superficial, fake, happy-mask people-pleasing. Yet, many coache
are stuck in the “I’m nice, I’m helpful!” trap. Sure, you’ll be beloved, praised... and
broke, polishing up your corporate résumé. Or, you could take risks, speak the truth
change lives, and close high-fee clients who actually respect you.

Here’s the deal: You need to live on the edge of “I’m scared of how they'll react”

because that’s where the magic happens. Think of it like this: are you the bartender
the personal trainer? The bartender pours your drinks till 3 a.m.; you forget their nan
by morning. The trainer charges $100 an hour, drags you out of bed at 5 a.m., yells :
you sadistically to do another rep, and somehow, you Jove them for it. Be the trainer

Drop the surface-level nice act. No one needs another LinkedIn love fest or “hope
you’re well!” DM. Act like you’re already the coach with 35 clients paying $500 a

session. Would that person have time to cold call or write sonnets in LinkedIn
comments? Nope. Act as if you’re already that person.

Here’s the inconvenient truth: being “agreeable” won’t make them trust you. If you
don’t call them out, push them out of their comfort zone, and challenge their lies (to
you and themselves), they'll never see you as the person who can break them out o°
their rut. Every move you make to get them to “like you” just builds a second wall—*
money wall. Instead, meet their excuses head-on.

When they start with, “I’m just not that kind of person” or “That could never work fo
me,” call it out. “Is that true, or is that just your fear talking?” Look them in the eye (
Zoom) and hold up the mirror. You might be the first person who’s ever done that foi
them.

| once had a client with a book, a retreat, and a solid method, yet he charged
embarrassingly low fees. On the first call, | said, “Nothing about you, your business,
your method should hold you back from commanding top-tier fees. The only thing
stopping you is your perception of your value.” Five minutes in, breakthrough. He sti
calls that moment life-changing. Me? | was just speaking my mind.

Radical honesty gets results. Give people the breakthroughs they need, not the
sugarcoated nonsense they want. Do this, and you'll never run out of clients who'll 5
whatever you ask. They don’t need a friend—they need a coach who can change th
life.

“How do you handle the load?” clients ask. Simple: | don’t work with toxic energy
vampires. If talking to my clients doesn’t feel like sipping espresso for my soul, they
don’t make the cut. I’m here to be energized, not exorcised.

Client Q: Is bumping, GIFing, and chasing low status lame? How do you avoid it?

A: If you do it with an IDGAF vibe—think The Outsiders cool, James Dean hair greas
or a Young Elvis pelvic twirl—you’re golden. It’s all about the tone. Writing, gifs, ever
punctuation—it all oozes intent. Care too much, and you’re needy. Go out of your w:
and you’re desperate. But strut in like you just dropped a killer guitar solo and flippe
the principal the bird, and now you’re Billy Idol with a rebel yell? That’s the secret
sauce.

| get away with murder in my messaging because | love to provoke, and I’m genuine
detached from rejection. After 10,000 hours of cold calling and sending more emails
than Gmail’s server admins, rejection is just white noise.

And let’s be honest—this stuff is Social Dynamics 101. It’s dating but with money or
the line. Robert Cialdini probably did wink at The Game during his psychology lectul
Frames, neuro-linguistic programming (NLP), micro-scripting—it’s all Jedi mind trick
Like dating, one misstep—a bad joke, a misread reply—and you’re dead in the wate
I’ve AB-tested enough chat flows to write the Napoleon Hill sequel Chat and Grow
Rich.

Quick throwback: When | was 21, | worked in a call center. My job? Sell credit carc
insurance to people who lied about owning credit cards. Every American averages 2
cards, but ask them directly, and they’d say “No.” The trick? Follow up with, “Which
card do you normally use?” Nine out of ten would blurt, “Visa.” I’d reply, “Great! It
starts with a 4.” Boom—converted. That’s where | learned the power of tone and
specificity. Jedi-level mind tricks that apply to any sales conversation.

Now, about client acquisition:

Newbies always ask, “Why not just pitch directly?” Because that’s lazy order-taking
not client acquisition. Sure, you might luck out with in-market buyers, but swing
buyers—the ambivalent majority—will ghost you faster than a bad Tinder date.

The swing buyers are where the gold is. Like swing voters in the Electoral College, tl
need to warm up. No pitch slaps like, “Why aren’t you buying my course?” Instead,
find out where they’re stuck. What's their secret dream? What’s holding them back?
the first glimmer of hope they’ve seen in months. Pull them to Zoom, uncover their
struggles, and flip the polarity.

Without this, you’re stuck pitching thousands, praying 3% say yes. Sure, inbound
works if you run $25K/month in ads and have a YouTube empire, but unless you’re
Russell Brunson, good luck. The middle majority is where the real game happens fo
the rest of us mortals. Convert the “meh” to “maybe,” and you'll unlock a whole new
tier of success.

Provoke. Flip the script. Be Lady Gaga, not the rando at karaoke night butchering
"Bohemian Rhapsody."

Why The 4th Frame™ Works:

Let’s face it—your prospects’ brains are numb from all the identical LinkedIn pitches
that start with “Hi [First Name], hope you’re doing well!” That’s why | created The 4ti
Frame™, a “chat and grow rich” technique that throws those clichés out the window
No names, no pleasantries —just a bold, subconscious jolt that grabs attention faste
than a toddler with a drum set.

Proof? I’ve used this method to pull thousands of prospects to Zoom and close
millions in 1:1 coaching and team workshops at $500-$2,000/hr. And every time | st

this, people say, “Okay, but how exactly does it work?” Don’t worry—actual excerpt
of my threads are below. Spoiler: | don’t ask, “How’s your day?”

Blank Connects = Mystery:

Don’t try to win them over with small talk. Just blank-connect and make sure your
LinkedIn profile reads like a killer landing page: headline, About section, Featured—:
WIIFM (what's in it for them?). Let your testimonials and big-name clients do the hee
lifting. If they check you out, they'll add you back. Then hit them with a THREAD
SPARKER like:

“what’s Q3 looking like for you?” (all lowercase, like you’re too cool to care).

Skip the thank-you notes and polite intros. Provoke curiosity, shift gears, and pull to
Zoom.

Tailoring Without Overthinking:

Should you tailor DMs? Sure—but don’t overcomplicate it. Keep it simple:

Troubleshooting Too Many Freebies:

If you’re drowning in first meetings with freebie seekers, qualify in the DMs. Tie your
fees to RO! early:

When they ask, “What are your rates?” respond, “If someone’s quoting fees in a DM
they’re not the person you want. Let’s hop on a call to figure out your needs. I’ve go
packages for every budget.”

Equity is Not Lunch Money:

Equity sounds sexy—until you’re eating ramen and explaining to your kids why
Monopoly money doesn’t work at the grocery store. Only take equity if you’re
passionate about the mission and getting paid upfront. When someone says, “Can |
pay you a percentage of the deals | close?” hit them with this:

“No. You’re paying for my time, like hiring a competent attorney. Skin in the game =
accountability to change. It should sting a little.”

Spec Work? Red Flag City:

When asked to work on commission, | calmly reply: “If a coach agrees to work on pi
commission, run. That’s a red flag. Top coaches don’t do that. | don’t guarantee
results—but | guarantee 24 years of experience and my full focus to crack your case
you're serious, let’s roll.”

. What else have you tried?

. What's holding you back?

Note: The precise moment you suggest a meeting and drop your calendar is “the fli

people chat too long.

*Sometimes, you can use the 4th Frame for DMs and the 7-step for full-cycle selling.
Using both together is an advanced technique that requires experimentation and
developing a “gut” feel.

Sliding into DMs is a battlefield because text loves turning harmless messages into
passive-aggressive nightmares. “Hey, what time works for our meeting?” somehow
reads like, “What time works for our meeting, Karen?!” It’s so bad that HR now train
managers to use emojis—yes, emojis—to ward off drama. A well-placed © can
literally save careers.

So, when you ask a bold or spicy question, soften it with emoji magic. Like, “Can yc
clarify this? @” or “Hit that deadline yet? <7” Big, bold questions? Great for Zoom
DMs, they can hit like Darth Vader growling, “I find your lack of engagement
disturbing.” Emojis are the 2025 way of saying, “Relax, I’m not the Emperor.” ©

Saying things like, “That’s amazing! Have you ever worked with a coach?” or “Wow,

And if they still drag their feet, don’t hold back on a little reality check of what not
changing could look like, aka sticking with the status quo. (Chandler)

A client keeps asking me every day: “Which sparks work?”
I’m like: “ALL of them!”

Warning: This section is the most popular part of what might be the most infamous
chapter of any book I’ve written. Which is a huge flex! It’s ballsy to suggest “sell by
chat” is the new “cold calling.” But here’s the real risk: what happens when everyone
slides into DMs with these chat flows? Will the J/MM hit a saturation point, like Taki
Moore’s “Sell By Chat” did back when dinosaurs roamed the LinkedIn feed?

The answer? Flank. That’s not just a military term; it’s my secret weapon for linguisti
and heuristics. If the world goes shortform JMM™, you go long-form. If everyone’s
doing George Clooney bumps, channel your inner Jack Nicholson—gritty,
unpredictable, slightly unhinged. Zig while they zag. Heck, moonwalk if you need to.

This is why the JMM™ will outlast us all; OK, maybe not Cher and cockroaches. ;-)
Look at what 99% of people are doing, then do the opposite. If the world goes left, '
go right. If the world goes long, you go haiku. This strategy will still work when the y
starts with “3.” Because as long as people are predictable, you’ll always have the
upper hand. Or, as Jack would say, “You can’t handle the truth!” But trust me, your
prospects will.

Advanced Client Acquisition—Tips & Mindsets

A surefire way to snag clients? Join the ecosystem of a rival coach, swoop in for a
guest spot, and drop some top-funnel wisdom. If that coach is focused on landing t
big fish, congrats—you’re now the yin to their yang, cross-selling into each other’s
networks like a boss. Shake & Bake! They'll teach closing; you'll teach opening. “Dic
we just become best friends? Yep!” (Any Step Brothers fans?)

Next move: borrow content like it’s going out of style. Share a killer article or
recommend a book—just make sure it’s not yours. Chandler is the OG at this. It’s
simple: clients buy you. When you curate, add meaning, and explain why it’s relevar

you become the go-to, not the author. Too many coaches clutch their IP like it's the
last cookie, but the win is being seen as the trusted curator in their lives.

Pro Tip: Adopt the open-source mindset. Be the kind of person who can send clien
to a Tony Robbins event without losing sleep (Byron Katie’s probably next door
anyway). Relationships—and business—thrive on trust. When you show trust, you g
trust. Like Gordon "Sting" Sumner said: /f you love someone, set them free... or at le
let them explore other resources without losing your cool. Stop micromanaging your
clients’ journey—support their growth, even if some of it happens outside your
ecosystem. That’s how you build loyalty that lasts.

And now, the secret sauce to client acquisition: mastering the art of creating clier
anywhere. Sitting next to you on a plane? Client. Standing by you in line at Starbuc
Client. People-watching at the DMV? Yes, even there. It’s about training that radar tc
see potential, like scrolling a newsfeed or skimming a paper, and spotting a way to
help. Inner Jedi intuition kicks in.

I'll often spot someone in my LinkedIn feed, track down their number, and hit them t
on WhatsApp. Closed deals this way, believe it or not—that’s how | met Christian
Krause. He confirmed: “Yep, random Saturday morning cold call on WhatsApp.”
Sunday afternoon, Saturday morning—time zones blur, but the hustle is real.

| started messaging VPs: "What’s your game plan to finish Q4 strong?” One replied,
“Not into cookie-cutter approaches.” | shot back, “Cookie-cutter? Me? No, but that’
cute.” He said, “Alright, let’s chat.” Boom—a 30-minute WhatsApp call compressed
two weeks into one real-time close.

The trick? Stephen Covey’s “speed to trust.” It’s the high-level, straight-to-the-point
move. See a prospect online with their LinkedIn circle glowing bright green? Skip th
wait; pull them into Zooms, FaceTime, SMS, or whatever it takes to get honest abou
the challenges and dreams they haven’t even admitted to themselves yet. No one’s
time to wait—so start future-proofing your pipeline now.

Chapter 7: Executive Targeting: Reach C-Level Clients & Build
Coaching Funnels

One of the sneakiest limiting beliefs new coaches cling to is this gem: “/ can only he

them the goods, and they’re up for anything.

Pro Tip: Follow the money. Target VPs, C-suite execs, board members, bestselling
authors, and serial entrepreneurs. Worried your résumé isn’t fancy enough? Doesn’t
matter. Solve their problem better and faster than they can, and they'll hire you.
High-level clients respect your time, crave insights, and won’t haggle over price. The
result? Smooth engagements, big impact, and returns that make your bank account
a happy dance.

When chasing top-tier clients, here are a few hacks:

Tap the power nodes. Run a Sales Navigator search on connections of big names
Brendon Burchard or Aaron Ross. Overlap your networks, and boom—a
second-degree goldmine.

- Micro-file your case studies. Shrink those glowing testimonials to under 100KB <
they’re ready to DM at a moment’s notice. Small file, big leverage.

- Let them write the curriculum. Present a syllabus of your offerings and let them
choose, like a menu. Coaching proposals should feel like the lease agreement for a
$95K BMW—pages of itemized brilliance that scream, “This is worth every penny.”

Mindset Hack: Act like they’ve already signed on at $500/hr or $5K/month. Coach i
they’re already a client from the first call. What would you say? How would you deli\

Steve Chandler nailed it: “Be real and tell them the truth about their problems.”
Translation: stop tiptoeing around and ask the bold questions:

- “What’s the story behind your divorce?”
- “Tell me about losing your job.”
- “Where are you suffering in life?”

It’s intense, but this is coaching, not karaoke night. People don’t need a cheerleader
they need someone brave enough to walk them through the fire. | once told a fractic
CRO making $150K/year, “You don’t need mindset coaching? Really? Then why are
you under-earning by six figures?” He hired me on the spot.

The fastest way to earn trust is by breaking rapport—strategically. Don’t be a “yes
coach.” Spend 80% of the time encouraging and 20% challenging their worldview.
Most clients block their growth with limiting beliefs they can’t see. After coaching

superpower, too. The real question is, are you bold enough to call it out? They'll love

Troubleshooting:

Go too hard too soon, and you might snap the line. If you’re delivering blunt truth
bombs, use the Oreo technique:

1. Start with something nice.

2. Slide in the critique.

3. End with another positive.

For example: “Jane, your writing is brilliant, and you’re fiercely independent. We nee

was the way to go—negging prospects and flaunting his success like a bad dating
coach. Sure, it worked short-term, but it left scorched earth, hurt feelings, and poter
lawsuits in his wake. Coaching means encouragement. Period. If you don’t respect
your clients, they'll always feel it.

Final Word: Clients don’t need fluff or feel-good vibes. They need bold, actionable
truth. Be the coach who isn’t afraid to shine a spotlight on their blind spots, and you

The Coaching & Consulting Funnel— Breakthrough Required

| tackle limiting beliefs within the first 10 minutes of any session. Nail this skill, and
you'll swim in clients faster than you can say “imposter syndrome.”

“You don’t think you’re qualified to be a consultant?” Please—you’ve done more thé
had when | started, and I’ve made millions. “Can’t picture charging $500 an hour?”
Look, people out there are charging that just to talk about charging that. ;-) You have
track record that blows seasoned coaches out of the water. Here’s the deal: confide
in your value is like a magic wand for client trust and primo rates. Crack open that
self-doubt, and clients will see you as their secret weapon, the coach they literally ci
afford to miss.

Here’s a real pep talk | gave a client:

“Listen, you’re either making this happen or not. Fearless action wins—think jumpin:
off buildings with a parachute you packed yourself. Training and coaching? It won't
on their priority list if you don’t make it a priority for them.”

Caution: Dealing with corporate types—VPs, CXOs, and CEOs—is like navigating a
minefield of red tape and oversized egos. You can’t just waltz in, drop a truth bomb,
and tell them their baby’s ugly. That’s a one-way ticket to getting ejected faster than
crass political joke at an investor meeting. Instead, take the stealthy approach:

e Build them up.
e Listen to what’s working.
e Nod at their successes like you’re watching a TED Talk.

Once their guard is down, you can gently point out the gaps. Think scalpel, not
sledgehammer.

And forget those epic two-hour coffee chats Rich Litvin used to rave about—ain’t

Don’t waste time with “tire kickers” fishing for free consulting. Trust your gut—it’s lik
spidey sense for time-wasters. You probably are if it feels like you’re giving away toc

nature after about 50 enrollment calls.

Here’s my model: if you want seven figures in coaching, you can’t just throw spaghe

deals, you'll need 2-3 disco calls before dropping your fees. But at some
point—BAM—you hit them with:

Alan Weiss is right: the more you slow down and invest upfront, the bigger the ultim

don’t need this business. It’s the magic of a full pipeline—Kraig Kleeman nailed it wt
he said, “Pipeline cures all ills.”

When you have more clients than you can shake a stick at, you can afford to be
choosy, focusing only on those who align with your vision (and won’t be a massive
headache). That abundance? It’s pure freedom. It’s the credibility boost that says, “I
don’t need you, but if you’d like, I’m here to make you a success story.”

The second a potential client smells even a whiff of neediness, they’re out, or at bes
on the fence. You could be following every tactic in this book like gospel, but the
game's over if you come across as even slightly desperate.

The solution? Take on 5-15 clients at whatever rate you can get, coach them, and
become “so good they can’t ignore you.” (Cal Newport / Steve Martin) Collect
testimonials, referrals, and word-of-mouth buzz, and watch your rates skyrocket. Th
isn’t just client acquisition—it’s the way to go from “just a coach” to “the coach.”

Without clients, coaches descend into the scarcity vortex—an endless spiral of
insecurity, desperate LinkedIn posts, and rage-reading The Subtle Art of Not Giving
F***, Stop the madness. Get The 50th Law by 50 Cent and Robert Greene on your
nightstand and ditch the people-pleasing. Not all clients are your people, and that’s
okay—you’re not auditioning for America’s Got Talent. The right ones will eventually
line up, credit cards in hand, asking you for permission to work together.

Clients are like goldfish trapped in a jar—oblivious to the water they’re swimming in.
They see the symptoms (| need more leads, | can’t find a niche), but you know the r
cause (fear of being boring, rampant shiny object syndrome). You’re the one with the

by step 4 when they finally admit their problem. That’s the magic of the Scott Leese
“Addiction Model.” Steps 1-3 ease them enough that by step 4, they’re ready to dro,
their guard and spill what’s really going on.

Pressure test the first goal they give you; most people throw out fluff goals like “I jus
want more work-life balance.” Uh-huh - as if that’s a thing! ;-) It’s your job to nudge

them into seeing the bigger picture. Show them what their true North Star is and loc
in. Get ready to help them think beyond their wildest corporate fantasies!

7 Steps to Closing So Smooth, It’s Practically Hypnosis

1. Find the Goal

Ask, “What’s your goal?” It’s almost always money, status, or revenge (VP by June,
Karen). lf they get poetic about “balance,” steer them back to the tangible stuff—lik
doubling income or crushing Q1.

2. Unpack the Real Why

“What’s behind that?” The goal isn’t just about cash; it’s about escaping debt, fundi
dream vacations, or winning arguments at Thanksgiving. Be a detective, not a
yes-man.

3. Clear Out the Baggage

“What else have you tried?” Cue the therapy session. Their past “solutions” are like
bad exes—they need a controlled burn to make space for hope. And FYI, hope sells
better than a free iPhone.

4. Find the Blockers
“What’s holding you back?” Translation: What’s the excuse playlist running on repez
their head? (Pro tip: Don’t say, “It’s you,” even if it is. Just nod and look wise.)

5. Share Your Messy Comeback

Tell your vulnerability story—how you flopped, learned, and crushed it. Everyone lov
a good underdog-to-hero David Goggins story. Bonus: It makes you human and shc
them transformation is possible.

6. Flip the Script (Polarity Shift)

At this point, they’re selling themselves to you. When they ask, “What’s your fee?” t
not to look too smug. If they don’t, casually slide it in: “Want to know what working
with me looks like?”

7. End with Possibility, Not Price

When fees come up, keep the focus on their dream scenario—not sticker shock.
“Imagine hitting [insert their big goal here].” Nobody wants to buy “affordable.” They
want transformation with a bow on it.

This is why Step 7 is gospel: tie fees to ROI. Throw it back to Step 1—“What’s your
goal?” —because nobody stays up at night fantasizing about saving a few bucks.
They’re dreaming about tripling their income, getting promoted, or shutting up that
smug coworker in accounting by suddenly splitting their time in Tuscany.

Remember! By minute 20, it’s time to drop the “money conversation.” Will they squil
Probably. Will they grimace? Likely. But this is your moment to channel your inner
therapist/coach hybrid. Hold space. Be the calm eye in the center of their storm of
doubt. You’re not here to pitch but to guide them into the cave they fear entering:
investing in themselves. If you’re not willing to lead them through it, who will? Gand:
(News flash: it’s you.)

If they hit you with, “What are your fees?” or “Can you walk me through your
program?” do not, | repeat, DO NOT launch into logistics and turn into a human
PowerPoint presentation. Nobody buys coaching because of cheat sheets,
pre-recorded workshops, or Slack group access. Hit them with this instead:

“The program is you: your self-limiting beliefs, the lies you tell yourself about money
the way you hold yourself back. I’m the mirror that shows you what’s missing and hi
to fix it.” (Chandler paraphrasing).

If it’s a team lead, tweak it to: “I’m here to identify where your reps are stuck and he!
them break through.” Translation: | know what’s wrong, and | can fix it.

This is where you remind them of the magic:

- We'll break through your limiting beliefs and self-sabotage.

- We'll uncover your unique zone of genius and monetize it fully. (“You're a razor witl
many blades; my job is to sharpen them all.” Hat tip, Marylou Tyler)

- We'll combine my 24 years of experience with your expertise. (“1+1 doesn’t equal
2—it equals 11.” Thanks, Dad, for that math bomb.)

By this point, they’re nodding so hard their neck hurts, and you’ve just opened the
door to talk money.

When you get there, frame it like this: “My fees are designed to weed out the
uncommitted. Imagine hiring a Navy SEAL for $200. Would you even bother waking

your transformation.”

Boom. They’re not thinking, “How much does this cost?” They’re thinking, “Am | rea
to be Navy SEAL-level committed to my goals?”

Don’t snooze on the follow-through when they say yes—and trust me, they will. This

where Steve Hardison’s “event-action” rule comes in hot. Fire off that invoice
immediately. Don’t give them a second to overthink or suddenly decide they “need”

that cash for a last-minute yoga retreat in Bali. Strike while the FOMO is fresh.

Oh, and yes, people crack up at the “You’re fired” sign in my 3 Walls diagram. They
love to say, “Thanks, JM, you’re fired,” once they’ve squeezed every last drop of my
wisdom. But let’s be real—these same “I can’t afford it” types magically “find” the c
for a neon-pink motorcycle with a sidecar for their dog the moment they want to.
Coincidence? Please.

If all else fails and they still won’t crack, channel your inner Shakespeare. Break the
fourth wall and say: “I’m here to change your life. What do you want to change? Wh

not working? What’s the opportunity you’re afraid to seize?”

It’s raw. It’s uncomfortable. And it works. Because here’s the truth: transformation is

cheap—but staying stuck is a hell of a lot more expensive.

Landing the plane / effectively ending the first call:

“It’s either a hell yes or hell no—there’s no ‘hell maybe.” (Litvin). “Look, | get it. This
big decision; I’m not here to pull some one-call-close jiu-jitsu move on you. Take yo!
time. Go chat it over with your CEO, aka your significant other. I’ll add you on
WhatsApp and flood you with guides, testimonials, and real-life stories. Heck, I'll
introduce you to some clients who'll tell you the good, the bad, and the ‘Oh wow, th
happened?’ ;-)”

Then let those intros run wild. Don’t hide from being back-channeled! You'll be
shocked who advocates for you, sometimes even your worst enemy. I'll send 50+
testimonials and brazenly tell them to contact whomever they want. I’ve had some

Let’s break it down—the Justin Michael Method 3 Walls Model™ in all its glory: a
complete, unstoppable client acquisition system for solopreneurs designed to turn
hesitant prospects into hell-yes clients. Here’s how it works:

1) Ine Vonnection ana invitation (VIvIs)

Start with the 4th Frame, “chat and grow rich,” on LinkedIn. Spark curiosity and pull
them onto Zoom. Easy.

2) The 7-Step Close (First Zoom Call)

Flip the script: build trust through vulnerability, shift polarity, and let them sel/
themselves on you. By the end, they’re thinking, “I need this coach in my life.” (Hat t
to gifted UK coach Matt Evans for inspiring the element of “seller vulnerability to
cultivate buyer trust” inside the enrollment discussion.)

3) The Money Conversation (Minute 20)
Drop the fee around minute 20 of a 30-minute call or the 45-minute mark on a longe

one. Proactively ask: “What comes up for you around the fee?” Stay present. Some:
confides, “Johnny Mnemonic burned me for $18K.” Respond: “Let’s talk about that.’

4) The Breakthrough (Investing in you!)

The “aha” moment hits. They’re ready to sign, and you’ve guided them to it like a pr
Now, tie your fees to ROI. I'll say: “You lost $100K on bad coaches? |’ll help you ma
a 5-15X return—plus that $100K back. Let’s turn this into a redemption story.” They
laugh, but they get it. Coaching isn’t a cost; it’s a cash machine.

Money Objection Comebacks:

“I help clients generate $60K-$1 80K per year in additional income. If all we do is pay
off my $12K fee, we’ve failed. My fees are a commitment to weed out the
uncommitted. $5K/month, 3-month minimum commitment for a 5-15X return. It’s eit
a hell yes or hell no—there’s no hell maybe.” (Chandler/Litvin inspo)

Not ready to commit on the spot? “Check with your CEO—aka significant other. Tall
my clients; they’re my best closers.”

Once the transfer clears, it’s game on. | fire over a Calendly link so they can schedul
ad hoc sessions as needed—none of that rigid weekly meeting nonsense. Why?
Because I’m a firehose of tactics, and 90-minute calls tend to melt brains. This way,
cut the fluff and dive straight into action. My style? Think CrossFit for human
performance, minus the chalk dust and occasional ego bruises.

your calendar. You want to create some pull, some mystery, a little “What's this wize
going to teach me?” vibe so they appear curious. | swear, | had a client who would

solve all their clients' problems within five minutes. Hold something back! Let them

have some “a-ha” moments. If you blow their mind in the DMs or during the first five
minutes of the call, why bother meeting?

Qualifying clients with endless forms is like hosting a dinner party and making guest
fill out a five-page menu—zero intrigue! One client's seven-step form screamed $99
gym membership, not $25K coaching. High-end coaching should feel like a chef’s
tasting menu: exclusive, effortless, and full of surprises.

Meanwhile, some “11X” trainers out there will pull any trick to close a sale, advocati
used-car-lot tactics that make you feel like you need a shower. Here’s my approach
“catch and release.” Be willing to walk away. Trust me—nothing’s more attractive the
not needing them. They’ll be drawn to you like cats to an empty box.

And here’s the follow-up trick: after the call, don’t rush, push, or hound them. Give
them space. Then, slide back into their DMs a day or two later with some real value
(and no “just checking in” snooze fest). Try: “Here’s a quote that reminded me of oui
convo,” or, “Check out this Substack article | wrote.” You could even throw them a li
to a talk by Neville Goddard, David Bayer, or Kathleen Cameron. Keep it classy; kee
cool.

Now, about fees: upfront payments only! Why? Because without skin in the game,
you'll end up in your own personal Jerry Maguire sequel, begging clients to “Help m

Salesborg doesn’t just tolerate humans—he even finds them mildly entertaining on
occasion. ;-)

Here’s the deal: if you niche down too far, you’ll end up eating ramen and explaining
your kids why dessert is just air tonight.

The secret? Stop treating your “ideal client” like an impossible mission to decode
enemy intel—this isn’t James Bond, and your client isn’t hiding in a villain’s lair. Foci
on the human in front of you. Call out their blind spots, obliterate their “woe is me”
mindset, and upgrade them into a self-empowered rockstar. Say “custom” and
“bespoke” so much it could be a drinking game. Why? Because people pay for
personal. Think sweaty Zumba class vs. a Jocko Willink Navy SEAL experience
dragging you up a mountain 1:1. Which one screams premium?

Wrap it all in a logistics container (yes, | know, it sounds like IKEA for business). Offe
flexibility, ad hoc access, and a clear plan: “We meet twice weekly, unlimited chat,
async support—what’s our first mission?” Boom. Now you’ve got a high-touch
program that screams exclusivity and slaps a big, fat price tag on itself.

So, how do we de-niche?

Forget “Greg, the disgruntled CFO with action figures.” That’s like designing a roller
coaster for one guy—what’s the point? Focus on the fireworks: results so dazzling tl
make clients feel like they’re front row for a Fourth of July finale. Nail this, and client:
will swarm like kids chasing churros.

Leap across industries like you’re park-hopping between Disneyland and Magic
Mountain—fast, fearless, and too busy creating magic to care about job titles. Just
don’t water down your genius into theme park nachos—functional, but nobody’s lini
up for it. You’re going from niche to Disneyland: a must-see attraction for everyone
without losing your magic. Flaunt your wins like a parade float, collect success storii
like souvenir mugs, and soon your business will run like Space Mountain—wild,
thrilling, and leaving everyone screaming, “Again!”

We all have the same 24 hours. All we control is how hard we swing the ax. Fortune
favors the bold, so go big. Instead of a generic ask, laser-focus on an insight they’v«
never heard. Hold people accountable for beliefs they’ve never questioned. Dig for
what truly drives them. As Litvin says, “Find their secret dream.”

Here’s the deal: closing a $25K/month client isn’t all that different from closing a
$3K/month client. But my rule for fees? If you charge too little, you resent the client;
you charge too much, they own you. My $25K/month client set me up like a Fractior
VP and ran me ragged with seven Zoom calls a week, usually about product market
(help!).

Anchor every deal with a high-fee offer, like six months of 1:1 consulting. Then,
down-sell into a group or cohort if needed. It’s like a BMW dealership: you walk in
drooling over the $150K M5, and before you know it, you’re leasing a 3-Series for
$500/month. BMW’s a genius bank with wheels—3, 5, 7, 9. Your group offering can
the gateway drug to your 1:1 work, but remember, these are often two different
audiences.

Coaches often start clients in low-fee cohorts and then wonder why they’re not
upgrading. Anchor high, down-sell if necessary, but don’t box yourself into the barg
basement.

And here’s a pro tip: If you offer someone $12K for 1:1 and they have $4,500, take tl
$4,500 and customize a mini-plan. $15K from five $3K clients beats the heck out of
of 0.

Above all, keep that confidence dialed up to eleven. Clients can sense even a
microgram of self-doubt. Cultivate unwavering belief in yourself, your BT] 23 0f 140 |

Here’s the deal: the number one reason to stay positive isn’t just to feel good—it’s
because you’re modeling that mindset for your clients and yourself. You’re literally
selling belief. If you want to inspire change, you have to be the change. (Nelson
Mandela said it first, but we'll roll with it.)

Now, if you’re out here trying to build a coaching empire while secretly resenting yot
clients’ success or getting competitive with them, you’ve got some soul-searching t

Step 1: Write down everyone you resent like you’re making a hit list, but less murde!

forgiveness! And YOU get forgiveness!” ;-)

Step 3: Take it up a notch: hype them up, send them good vibes, and genuinely wis

belief and kill it. Kathleen Cameron had a Network Marketing business where she m
the same number of cold calls daily and shifted into a positive self-identity, knowing
she'd attract clients. Suddenly, her success rate shot up, but the kicker was that shr
wasn’t doing anything differently. She just changed her attitude. It’s quantum
mechanics; how we perceive the world impacts the outcome.

“Your attitude, not your aptitude, will determine your altitude.” - Zig Ziglar

CLIENT: Is there anything wrong with dropping all my fear and anxiety about it, not
working out, relaxing, and trusting God while also taking massive action? All the wo
and fear are exhausting, and none of these worst-case scenarios | have in my head
materializing; it's the opposite.

JM: When you were a top AE, did you live in constant worry and fear?
CLIENT: No, not at all. It was the opposite.

JM: So why make this mistake now? | say this with love. Optimism and positivity wi
allow you to grow. How can you believe you'd crush AE and fail as a coach? Enterp
software sales is 10 times harder, IMHO. Quiet your mind and realize this job is way
easier. Logically, think about it; this was my calculus.

Watch some lectures by Syd Banks. There is only Mind, Consciousness & Thought.
The 3 Principles. Per Michael Neill, ‘we are living in the feeling of our thinking.’ Every
fear, doubt, and worry is a thought. You are not your thoughts. YOU think your
thoughts. The rea/ you! You are the infinite awareness behind it all.

CLIENT: Amazing!

JM: Don't believe in negative thoughts; they are lies that don't exist, just patterns fr¢
trauma.

CLIENT: You are right

JM: We have 70K thoughts per day. 80% of our thoughts are harmful, and 95% are
repetitive (National Science Foundation). The same goes for Michael Jordan, Oprah
Winfrey, and Richard Branson; we are all hard-wired, instinctive human animals with
protectionist lizard brain.

So, believe in positive affirmations. Dwell on your testimonials. Dwell on your past
accomplishments. Nobody can take them away from you. Have faith, and potential
clients will sense all this. They'll feel it if you operate with hidden fear and doubt.

Remember, from a change in being, your thinking and doing change eternally.

My coaching superpower? It’s an ironclad, unshakable belief in myself that borders

you build an empire from thin air—the laser focus of a tiger mixed with the

unquestioning optimism of a golden retriever chasing a tennis ball.

If you’re not sold on yourself, your clients won’t be either. You need to love yourself
your own No. 1 fan and believe in yourself 1000%, or you'll be pushing that boulder
a hill like Sisyphus forever. Self-doubt? Not in this dojo. If you can’t hype yourself ug
how can you expect to transfer that belief to clients? They’ll sense any wobble in yo

depend.” - Winston Churchill

Enrollment Power—Status Dynamics & Frame Control
One-call closing is not the goal, although | often do serendipitously.

| wrap up most calls with a takeaway, usually by talking the client out of working wit
me. | love the Hormozi classic to pressure test the deal, “Why wouldn't you move
forward?” Or:

“Ed, | know this is a big decision. Let’s not lock this down on a single call. Why don’
you chat with your CEO, spouse, psychic—whoever you run big life decisions by? G
real talk from my clients on the good, the bad, and the awkward. We'll circle back nt
week.”

And if all you get from that first or second meeting is a request for a proposal? That’
win! As Alan Weiss says, “The more you frontload the relationship, the bigger the
close.” Translation: slow and steady brings the payday.

“Enrolling” isn’t a sleazy sales move—it’s a vibe. It’s about creating an energy so
magnetic they can’t resist leaning in. Enrollment doesn’t push, defend, or go into a
hostage negotiation parody. It’s just you, genuine and compelling, without trying toc

hard. When you take this “enrolling” approach, you’re not selling—you’re attracting
clients like they’re drawn to your gravitational pull.

Sandler and Costanza’s genius? “Do the opposite.” So when I’m onboarding a clien
go right for the heat. I’ll ask, “What concerns do you have? What’s holding you back
What’s the thing you’re not saying?” And if I’m making a referral, I’ll say, “Ask Aaron
what he didn’t like, OK?” Being a trustworthy advisor means offering the “full monty
360-degree experience—warts and all.

Leaning into the awkward stuff—the fee, their budget, their motivation (or lack
thereof)— builds more trust than the “used car lot” vibe. None of that “smile and noc
tell them what they want to hear” nonsense. Carolyn Freyer-Jones calls it out in her
books: show up as your professional self, not the people-pleasing “social self”
desperate for a pat on the head.

One of my favorite hard asks? “Billy, so...when am | coaching you? ;-)” Bold, right?
And the best response | got? Not a brush-off. Instead: “I’m saving up to afford you.”

"Hard closing" is like proposing on the first date—awkward, desperate, and sure to:
with someone sneaking out the bathroom window. Let’s keep it cool. Instead, think
as catch-and-release fishing. End the call with something smooth like, “I know this i:
big decision. Take your time, think about it, and feel free to chat with my clients.” Th
reel them back in with a follow-up the next day: “What’s been on your mind since w
spoke?” Offer a second call to tackle their hesitations, help them refocus on their
dream, and—if needed— MacGyver a way to find the money.

“The greatest fear in the world is of the opinions of others. And the moment you are
unafraid of the crowd, you are no longer a sheep; you become a lion. A great roar
arises in your heart, the roar of freedom.” — Rajneesh (Osho). (Translation: stop beinc
sheep.)

Coaching exists because people are stuck on their personal /s/and of Frustration,
surrounded by sharks, seaweed, and saltwater, making them grumpy. Your job? Be
their boat to the /sland of Awesomeness, brimming with fresh coconuts, a protective
reef, and stellar WiFi. Carolyn Freyer-Jones calls it The Island Metaphor. Ask them:

Why they
pay you

“Create your future from your future, not your past.” - Werner Erhard

Why do they pay you? Rich Litvin nails it: They pay because they’re confident you’v:
delivered results for people just like them. It’s not about how many IPOs you’ve exit
or the fancy coaching certificate you laminated at Kinko’s print shop. They hire you
because you’ve transformed yourself and helped others cross the same chasm they
staring at. You’ve moved them from their default future to a created one a la Werner
Erhard, which is absolutely priceless, my friends.

Tell them stories. “I had a client just like you. Here’s where they started, and here’s
where they ended up. Ask them about it!” Transparency is sexy—and enrolling. Don
hide your backchannel; make all your clients referenceable. If they trust your track

record, they'll believe you’re the boat that gets them where they need to go: sharks
all.

Bank up a stash of testimonial screenshots and videos like your life depends on it. It
you're just starting, coach some friends for free or at a discount. Don’t worry—they’
pay you back in glowing reviews.

“Had two sessions with Justin and closed $7K already.” - Donie

See? Proof sells.

Now, let’s talk about status. As the coach, you must hold the more powerful frame.
Why? Because the second you let the balance slip, the roles reverse, and suddenly,
they’re coaching you. It’s like dating—don’t let them put you in the friend zone (FZ).

“Do you want to have a chat?” they ask.

“I don’t do chats,” you reply. “I charge $2,000/hr, but I’m happy to invest some time
brainstorming how to double your income by 2025. No hard sell.” Then you drop the
Zoom link like a boss.

Sure, you can give away the first call as a complimentary session, but set the tone:
“This is an experience of my coaching, not free consulting.” If they say, “I’m broke,”
you decide if a 20-minute coffee chat is worth your time—or if they’re just
window-shopping for free advice.

Stay out of wishy-washy networking limbo. Phrases like “Let’s just network and see
what happens” are code for “I’m going to waste your time with free consulting and
vague promises.” Make your intentions clear from the start: “I’m the coach. You're tt
client | want to help. Let’s get to work.” That’s holding the frame.

And yes, you're going to get ghosted. Clients will give you a verbal green light, only
vanish like they’re starring in a David Copperfield magic act. If you catch them live, «
“What’s getting in the way?” Offer to book another call to dive deeper into their
challenges and remind them of the dream.

Here’s the play: Reorient them to their vision, the second island, the land of WiFi anc
fresh coconuts. Keep their focus on value, ROI, and social proof until the “pain of

staying the same” outweighs the “pain of change” (Brent Adamson). Sell the dream,
not the price tag. Keep them living in possibility, not affordability, because nobody ¢
inspired by a discount code.

Top 11 Ways to Enroll Clients Without Sounding Like a Pushy Salesbot from
Planet Close-lItron
(heart of this book & method!)

1. No hard closing (Soft sell vs. hard sell)
Think of it like a first date: no one whips out a prenup over appetizers. Let it breathe

2. Catch and release (be willing to walk away)
Be like a cool cat with a toy mouse. Bat it around a bit, then walk away. They’ll com:
chasing.

3. Slow down to speed up
Don’t floor it. This is more of a Sunday drive and less NASCAR. Let them want to
accelerate.

4. Leverage testimonials and reference clients
It’s like saying, “Don’t take my word for it; ask the fan club.” They’re not hiring you jt
for your charm—they need proof.

5. Give them the breakthrough, which is hiring you
Sometimes, their greatest lightbulb moment is realizing they’re investing in themselv
You’re the Coach Everest of their financial decisions.

6. “The cave they fear to enter contains the treasure they seek!”
(Hat tip: Joseph Campbell and Paulo Coelho) Translation: that scary investment? Ye
that’s where the magic happens.

7. Other orientation and deep listening (it’s all about them!)
Put the jazz hands down. Pulling an Anchorman with a flaming jazz flute? Awkward,

unnecessary, and nobody asked. Chill—humble beats Rolex every time.

8. Vulnerability = trust = polarity shift

File Edit View Tools ... XN

Show a crack in that polished exterior; it’s like giving them a key to the inner circle.

9. Get creative in finding the money
Who says the money has to be in their bank account? Get scrappy. There’s always ¢
way.

10. There are no “nos” —only boomerangs
A “no” is just a client taking the scenic route. They'll be back. Trust.

11. Who you are attracts clients
Confidence isn’t loud. It’s that quiet, “I’ve got this” vibe that says you’re the alpha
leader they’ve been waiting for.

Mastering the Money Talk—Breaking the 2nd Wall

She smiled and asked, “So, how do | pay you?” | nearly high-fived myself. This coul
be you soon—let’s get you there.

Too many coaches hear the slightest hesitation from a client and buckle. The client
winces, and suddenly, you’re offering a discount like you’re running a clearance sale
Resist the urge! Instead, ask, “What’s coming up for you around the fee?” If they sa’
can’t afford it,” don’t drop the price—dig in. “Ever invested in something like this
before?” Maybe they’ll go, “Yeah, | spent $25K on mindset coaching, and it didn’t
work.” That’s your opening. “Oof, that sounds frustrating.” Clear the old
disappointment so they can leave their “default future” (a.k.a. “stuckville”) behind ar
step into the breakthrough they actually want.

Remember, they’re investing in themselves — often more than they’ve ever spent on
anything other than a car or a kitchen remodel. Are they crossing that investment
threshold? That’s where the magic happens. And you’re the coach who got them th

Whenever they ask your fee, don’t just blurt it out like you’re selling a sandwich. The
rookie stuff. Try this layer cake flow instead:

1) Methodology >> 2) Logistics >> 3) Fees tied to ROI

Throw in, “Want me to walk you through how | work?” Make sure they get it. Then,
ease into the logistics. Finally, hit them with the fees but close on that sweet 5-15X
return. Let the results speak louder than the sticker shock.

Money objections

| will say, “If it takes 9 months to pay off my 12K or 15K, that’s a huge fail. My
reputation is damaged. | want this to be the turning point in your life. | want you to Ic
back in 2026 and say, ‘Oh snap, this Justin Michael guy in the funny animal hat is w
earned 200K more, even millions more, toward 2030.’ Otherwise, what are we doing
here? Let’s not waste each other’s time.”

Troubleshooting the Money Conversation

If money’s the hurdle, you’ve got two choices: go after clients with deep pockets or
crafty with payments. When in doubt, suggest some unconventional “funding
strategies:” credit cards, loans, or even a friendly call to Aunt Edna for a little “perso
growth sponsorship.” Only about 5% of clients can drop big bucks without blinking
top 5% of Americans make $335,891). But there’s often inheritance, family cash, or
mysterious box of old coins somewhere. As long as you deliver results, it’s all fair
game!

| once had a minor league baseball player making $35K wire me $15,000 for coachil
because he was thrown into an SDR leadership role and needed immediate help not
flop. When people truly feel the need, they find the funds— without pain or urgency,
there’s no sale. I’ve seen clients cash out Google stock, Bitcoin, and even unexpect
estate payouts. | didn’t chase this—they got resourceful.

97% of my clients crush it and get their investment back. The other 3%? They eithe
ghost halfway through or think “manifestation” means sipping Mai Tais and
scrapbooking.

And then there’s The Cutting Board Caper. This guy starts mailing everyone oak
cheeseboards with notes like, “Can we carve out some time?” It was effective! Two

The point is that people will get creative if they’re serious about working with you. Yi
might need to help them brainstorm a bit. Ask them about their budget if they can’t
afford the full $12K. “Can you swing $4K?” If they say yes, you can start with a limit:
scope. Or give them the nudge: “Great, wire that by Friday, and we’ll make it happel

there—sometimes it’s just hiding behind a stack of fancy cheeseboards. ;-)

Money Checklist: Why They Didn’t Pay You (and How to Fix It)

1. You didn’t unlock their secret dream.

If you can’t make them picture their dream life like it’s a Hallmark movie montage,
they’re not pulling out their wallet. You need to be the Nicholas Sparks of coaching
pitches.

2. They didn’t trust you enough.
No trust = no money. They need to see you as the Gandalf of their journey, not som:
random vagrant yelling, “You shall not pass unless you Venmo me $5K!”

3. You bailed on the money topic too early.

If you got nervous and moved on, congrats—you left money on the table. Hold the
space, keep your cool, and coach them through their money hang-ups like a zen
master.

4. You didn’t get creative about funding.
Savings? Credit cards? Uncle Joe’s emergency “buy-a-boat” fund? Selling Bitcoin?

5. You didn’t create enough desire.
If you crank up their desire high enough, they’ll move mountains—and max out cred
cards—to work with you. Desire trumps budget every time.

6. Everyone has a credit card.
No, seriously. Even your grandma has one stashed “just in case.” Maybe it’s time fo!
you to roll out a Manifesting for Boomers program. ;-)

7. You didn’t ask for a partial payment today.

Get some skin in the game! Take $500, $1,000—whatever they can do now—and
scope the delivery. Five $3K deals in a week is $15K. You don’t need one big deal; y
need momentum.

8. You ignored their significant other’s influence.
Budget decisions are a team sport for most couples. Offer to get their partner on the
call. You’re not just coaching the client—you’re coaching the unit.

9. They’re in transition, and you didn’t coach them up.
If they’re between jobs, don’t write them off. Help them land the next gig so they cai
afford you. | wholeheartedly recommend 60 Seconds, and You’re Hired by Robin Ry

Coach them, connect them, and introduce them to your network. Before you know i
you'll be the career mafia don—people whisper your name in hushed tones, and
everyone owes you a favor they can’t refuse.

Pro Tip: Be the coach who’s so helpful they’d sell their Peloton to pay you. ;-)

No matter who you target, buyers are liars—it’s a universal truth. Everyone guards tt
bank accounts like dragons hoarding gold. Whether they’re making $400K with year
of GTM experience or just starting out, your job is to slow down, coach them arounc
the money, and grease the payment wheels. Get paid upfront for mutual skin in the
game. Once they invest, they’ll magically become 100 times more accountable.

Troubleshooting: The Money Conversation

File Edit View Tools ... XN

If you struggle to close, take the temperature early on the first call. If they’re playing
coy, try these:

- “You got on this call for a reason; what’s really going on in your life?”

- “Why would you talk to a coach if there’s nothing you want to change?”

When they hit you with “I don’t have the money,” respond:

- “What comes up for you around the fee?”

- “Have you been burned before?” (Hint: the answer is always yes.)

- “The average American has 3.84 credit cards—can you put it on one?”

- “How can we get creative to find the money?” (Family loans? Bitcoin? Selling the
Beanie Babies Collection?)

If they say, “It’s too expensive,” ask: “Relative to what? What if the ROI is 5-15X? Ta
to my client Scott about his results.”

I'll stay on this for 5-10 minutes, metering it carefully—minute 20 in a short call, mint
45 in a longer one. Timing matters.

Creative Payment Sources
Business loans, credit cards, family, stock, inheritance, Bitcoin—if they want it bad
enough, they'll find it.

Caveat: Ethics Matter

If you can’t drive ROI, don’t go after these sources. As Townsend Wardlaw says, “If
can’t deliver ROI, you’re not ready to be a true business coach.” Aim for at least a 3:
return or help them land a solid job first if they’re in transition. Alan Weiss’s Hippocre
Oath for Consultants applies: “Do no harm.”

Time Objections

When they say, “I don’t have time,” reframe it: “Then do it for your family—your anct
Showing up for yourself is showing up for them.” Or simplify with an W606 10 4
model: “It’s just 30 minutes, 2X per week, designed for high performers like you.”

“Il Need to Think About It”
Audit their baggage, own their losses, and bake that into your projected ROI. Reorie

focused on possibility, not affordability. Because, at the end of the day, staying the
same is more expensive than investing in change.

Chapter 10: Fulfillment Magic: Wow Your Clients and Keep The
Hooked

Honor your commitments. If you’re even thinking about rescheduling a call because
you're “just not feeling it,” grab a copy of Steven Pressfield’s Turning Pro and read it
until the flakiness seeps out of your system. This industry can be flakier than a
croissant in a windstorm, so show up on time, follow through, and own your slip-up:
You'll stand out like a unicorn in a parking lot.

Next up, protect your energy like it’s your ATM password. Block toxic people and tre
as needed. The world’s negativity supply is never-ending; you don’t need that baggi
in your next client session. But here’s the twist: sometimes, a little “strategic
forgiveness” works wonders.

Keeping bridges intact isn’t just karma—it’s career oxygen. Your network is like Wall
Street: play it right, and it compounds faster than Belfort’s penny stocks. Burn too
many bridges, though, and you'll ghost yourself out of the game faster than Bud Fo)
post-Gekko.

“Keep your friends close and your haters closer” —they’re basically unpaid interns fc
your PR. And as Robert Greene would say, “Never outshine the master.” Unless, of
course, you’re Gordon Gekko’s secret love child or plan to out-Belfort everyone witt
yacht, a mic, and a questionable supply of Quaaludes.

On calls, try “listening between the lines.” That means paying attention to what clien
say and what they don’t say. Think of it as psychic karaoke: you’re mentally belting :
their backstory while hearing their words. Some call it “deep listening” or “listening f
insight.” | like to imagine living in their shoes for a minute and tackling their problem:
like it’s my reality show.

Developing this level of active listening is a superpower. It’s like getting X-ray vision

Many people are stuck in victim mode, and as coaches, it’s our job to help them
realize, “Hey, you’re the one holding the remote here.” Or, as Steve Chandler says,
“You've created a perfect system for the results you’re getting.” The ego loves its cc
corner, even if that means staying in a rut, making the same money, and replaying li
greatest hits of setbacks.

Call it karma on repeat or life stuck in airplane mode—like an elite personal trainer w
refuses to let you skip leg day, a great coach doesn’t just nudge but sometimes sho
you out of your comfort zone. That’s exactly why clients are willing to pay top dollar:
have someone push them beyond what they believe possible.

In Justin Michael Method 3.0: Attraction Selling, | revealed everything | know about
Manifestation and the Law of Attraction for sales—except one game-changing insig|
inspired by the brilliant Regan Hillyer. Drawing from Michael A. Singer’s The Surrena
Experiment, | discovered two powerful flavors of manifestation: the well-known
“go-get-'em” approach and the lesser-known yet profoundly transformative
“surrendered” method.

To master client acquisition, embrace both.

Manufactured Manifestation is the classic goal-setting approach: you jot down thc
20MM goals, channel your inner Esther Hicks, and let the universe worry about the
how.

Surrendered Manifestation is next level: stop paddling like a lunatic and let the rive
do the work. Why kill yourself going upstream when the universe already has a VIP
cruise downstream? Michael Singer meditated in a field and accidentally floated intc
tech empire. That’s the art of letting go. And by the way, there are no accidents.

How do | apply this? | trust the right clients will show up exactly when I’
them. Every morning, | wake up excited about who | might meet, unlike M2050 |
panic-stricken coaches convinced “no one’s buying.” Surrender to a higher power, \
with abundance, and rewire your mind to expect awesome clients who pay your full
fees with a smile. That will become your ‘new normal’ reality.

And remember: clients don’t sign up to be wowed by a “superhero coach” in a Teflo
suit. If anything, they’re afraid you’ll see what a mess they are and that they'll flake c
you like every other self-improvement plan. Just be real. Be humble. No flashy wate
like Cardone or Miner—be the coach who’s more “let’s get real” than “let’s flex for
Instagram.”

Take the Godfather of coaching, Steve Chandler. He strolls into a Fortune 500 for a
coaching gig, and the sales leader asks, “What makes you qualified to coach my
team?” Without missing a beat, Steve says, “I went bankrupt, my wife was committe
I survived AA, and my four kids think food is a daily requirement.” The sales leader
grins and says, “You're hired.” Because clearly, nothing says role model like a perso
highlight reel of disaster recovery.

they’re terrified this might actually be the moment they have to face their own poten

They’re ready for a change, and they can trust you to walk with them through it. Tha
trust isn’t just why they'll sign up—it’s why they'll stay, transform, and succeed.

Like The Dummy Curve in Sandler, you need to be “more not OK” than they are. Be
vulnerable, share stories of your failures, and talk about how coaching transformed
you. The more they open up, the more you can change them.

From the intake to the first call, your mission is clear:

- Dive so deep they'll think you’re their emotional scuba instructor. Hold the most
powerful conversation of their life.

- Uncover their secret dream—whether it’s tearing through Monaco in an F1 car,
running for president to outlaw pineapple pizza, ditching their 9-to-5 to become a D.
or dating a supermodel and leaving DiCaprio sobbing into his Oscar, muttering, “Ho
did | lose her?”

- Get them to spill what’s really holding them back. Think part coach, part therapist,
part detective uncovering the plot twist in a true crime docuseries faster than you cz
say, Benedict Cumberbatch.

up to their potential.”)

2. What's their secret dream? (It’s more than “make money”; find the juicy details.)

How to Coach Without Being a Jerk ;-)

- Serve clients so powerfully they'll name their firstborn after you (or at least conside
it).

- Be vulnerable, humble, and brutally candid. Sugarcoating is for donuts.

- Share your flaws and failures like war stories; show how coaching saved your bac«
- Make it OK that they’re a hot mess. “You’re a mess? Same. Let’s get to work.”

- Reduce friction by acknowledging and empathizing like you’re customer service fc

- Be fascinated by them. Curiosity is love, and Jove wins.

Master this level of raw, unfiltered connection, and you'll close the gap between dot

Beyond The 3rd Wall: Referrals, Renewals, and LTV Curves

After 3 to 6 months, many clients think they’ve cracked the code and are ready to
graduate. But here’s the trick, straight from Bryan Franklin, who once coached Reid
Hoffman: “The more mysterious you are, the higher you can charge.” So if you want
clients to stick around, you’ve got to keep that air of mystery, like the coaching worl
David Blaine.

Keep them guessing! Vary your delivery algorithm. Stack model after model, layer uy
layer—one month, you’re the fundraising guru; the next, the team-building whispere
Avoid “spilling all your candy in the lobby,” as Sandler warned. Instead, dole out tho
insights like a Netflix cliffhanger—just when they think they know what’s coming, hit
them with a plot twist.

Familiarity breeds contempt, but variety is the spice of life—or maybe the spice of
Dune to turn their eyes glowing blue with awe. Choose your spice wisely!

When | started, | blasted through content like a firehose, and, surprise, it was
overwhelming. Effective coaching is more of a slow-burn art form. Take a tip from
ex-teachers like Josh Braun and Chris Caldwell, who know how to pace their genius
(probably from years of keeping 8th graders from setting things on fire). Working wit
teacher and math whiz clients inspired me to develop the “Monetization Diamond”
approach—a game-changing method that breaks cold calls into manageable modul
each focused on mastering a specific micro-skill. This isn’t just about quick wins; it’:
proven foundation for lasting expertise and long-term success.

To keep clients hooked, your content library has to be deeper than Prince's song
catalog. I’m talking seven books, 17 guides, and endless topics to zoom in or out. If
you're a sales leader, you can always find another angle—train their trainers, overha
their messaging, optimize their tech stack. You’re a Swiss Army knife, not a single-u
gadget.

And on referrals: forget blasting your email list with “Send me your friends!” Take it
slow. Get on a 1:1 call, catch up, and walk them through the referral process like yo!
introducing them to the secret menu. Shotgun referrals don’t work; everyone would
it if they did. Offer a referral fee they can apply to their coaching with you—make it
tempting. And while some top coaches have armies of appointment-setters and
closers, | keep it personal. When | take things slow and do everything myself, it’s go
that handcrafted feel, like a Swiss watch or a Savile Row suit.

Time to renew? Sweeten the deal to seal the commitment. If they initially signed up
a three-month plan but only paid for one, offer the previously upfront three-month

discount as an incentive when they're ready to go all in. | steer clear of pay-as-you-
or split-payment deals—they often lead to early drop-offs and lack of accountability

Pro Tip: Todd Caponi is the king of deal levers, and here’s a game-changing insight
upfront payments are always better—thank you, time-value of money! Longer

commitments (term) create stability, and the more reps clients get with you (just like
fitness routine), the greater the value they'll experience (scope). Craft a strategic list
“give-to-get” levers: “Sure, you can have that 30% discount, but in return, I'll need é
glowing testimonial once you crush your goals.” It’s a win-win—delivering results wt
securing your worth.

And here’s the kicker: sometimes, clients will start looking for reasons to bail just to
dodge the bill. It’s sneaky! They may not even know they’re doing it. That’s why it’s
best to get paid upfront. They'll dive in with both feet when they’ve got natural skin i

the game. Once they’re fully invested—emotionally and financially—they’ll show up,
give it their all, and truly change. It takes 21 days to rewire the brain, but a little upfre
commitment will make the difference.

The House Painter Metaphor

Now, flash forward: a house painter rolls into town, finds the shabbiest, most
paint-peeling house on the block, and decides to go full makeover mode. The tenan
are away, and when they get back, bam! Their place is gleaming in gloss white. The
painter leaves a stack of business cards in the mailbox, and soon enough, neighbor:
are pulling up like, “Who made your house look like that?” Cue business cards flyinc
out the door.

The idea? Find one person. Blow their mind with transformation. They’ll be your
walking billboard, spreading the word. And soon, just like Steve Martin said (and Ca
Newport wrote a book about), you'll “be so good they can’t ignore you.”

News spreads fast when you’re doubling incomes, revealing hidden purposes, or
cranking up someone’s self-esteem to 11. Jesus healed a few people, and suddenly

genuinely helping one person, a village will come beating down your door.

#9: Spending all your time on branding and marketing
— Ah yes, the classic “famous on Instagram, invisible in the bank account” strategy.

#8: Comparing yourself to other coaches
— Nothing screams “success” like constantly questioning your worth while scrolling
through LinkedIn at 3 a.m.!

#7: Rushing (slow down, you’re not a caffeinated squirrel)
— Slow and steady wins the race...unless you move so slowly, even a tortoise passe:
you.

#6: The Tender Trap - Pluralism!

— Who needs one happy client when you can half-serve a mob? Genius move. Rush
to shotgun clients just scares off the good ones. Want a winning cohort? Enroll ‘em
school—one at a time.

#5: Trying too hard
— Face it: needy = creepy. No one likes a coach who’s as clingy as a college ex.

#4: Ignoring your 1st circle warm leads
There is nothing like stepping over piles of cash to chase cold leads in Antarctica!

#3: Not asking for referrals
— Here’s a pro tip: offer 20% off referrals. Money talks, and you can stop doing all th
talking.

#2: Over-niching
— Why serve a broad audience when you can target that hyper-niche market of
left-handed llama herders?

And the #1 Coaching Blunder...Building emotional walls with clients
— Nothing says “I care” like keeping clients at arm’s length. “I’m here to help...but nc
too much.”

Avoid these, and who knows—you might just make it as a coach without becoming

Chapter 11: Growth Levers: Automate, Win Corporates, Perfect
Delivery

So many coaches come to me looking like Neo after dodging too many bullets,
gripping their bank accounts like they’ve just realized the Matrix is real, and they’re
running out of time. They’re on the “lumpy” revenue roller coaster—one moment
channeling their inner John Wick, walking into a room like “Yeah, | got this,” and the
next, Googling, “How to get a W-2 job without looking desperate,” as if the High Tak
is after them.

The fix? Lock and load your practice with 15-25 clients, even if it means temporarily
lowering your fees. As Robert Greene cryptically states in Mastery: “You're here to
master your craft so profoundly that the world has no choice but to pay attention.”
Translation? Jam-pack that pipeline like a trunk full of tactical gear, and suddenly, y«
income roller coaster feels less like a car chase through Rome and more like a slow
cruise to Zion. (Or, as Jeb Blount might monotone like Morpheus: “The pipe is life.”)

While you’re building toward that dream Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)—your
business’s version of reloading mid-gunfight—you need to commit 80% of your time
prospecting. Yes, 80%. Think of it as your red pill moment: you can pretend the
pipeline will magically fill itself, or you can face the reality that 3-5 “Are we a fit?” (Ae
Ross AWAF) calls per day is what keeps you in the fight. And even when your calen
is stacked higher than Wick’s body count, you stil/ need to prospect. Why? Because
nothing empties faster than a pipeline you’ve stopped filling—think of it as Neo
unplugging from the Matrix mid-fight. Not good.

"Perfect is the enemy of progress." — Voltaire (or maybe it was the Oracle after mak
cookies). Forget perfection. Run LinkedIn automation like it’s your arsenal, send 100
invites weekly, blast 800 open-profile messages, and DM every first-degree connect
like you’re calling for backup at The Continental. Will it be messy? Absolutely. But
messy, consistent action is your tactical advantage. Build that pipeline, master your
craft, and soon your coaching business won’t just survive—it’ll thrive, like Neo leveli
up or John Wick casually dismantling 40 enemies without breaking a sweat.

You can program your Automation du jour to:

- Send 40 1st degree personalized messages per day

- Add 100 targeted connections/week (LinkedIn caps at 400/mo—no need to speed
like it’s the Indy 500).

- Slowly add 800 Open Profiles 2nd degree (or risk LinkedIn slapping you like a
bouncer at a VIP club).

Pro Tip: Do the targeting yourself in Sales Nav. Why? Because automation loves
throwing curveballs—ask for CEOs, get Linda the massage therapist. Connection
requests are gold—don’t spend them like Monopoly money.

- Set up your first message, aka the “spark” (something better than your best Ryan
Gosling “Hey girl”).

- Handle the first back-and-forth yourself.

- Once connected, drop your opening like it’s hot and watch the magic unfold.

Prospecting is just like prayer; cue Madonna. Prospect unceasingly.

I’ve survived every rollercoaster—recessions, pandemics, and those random “what :
| doing with my life” slumps—by keeping my foot glued to the gas pedal, even on th
downhills. Think of Combo Prospecting, Tech-Powered Sales, and The JMM Trilogy
your instruction manual for building momentum, no matter the bumps.

When you start a coaching business, the first few months are like the honeymoon
phase. Clients from your inner circle flock to you, and life feels like a sales highlight
reel. Then, bam! Six months in, you hit the plateau of doom. You’re feeling tapped o
and suddenly, you’re like, “Where did everyone go?” That’s where | come in—to lea
you up the “slope of enlightenment” (sounds Gartner-level fancy, right?) and get you
back to a steady, sustainable flow.

Trust me, my clients hit slumps all the time. Remember: if you’ve done it once, you ¢
do it again. There are tens of millions of prospects, and only one you. Clients are ou
there; it’s time to dust off that confidence. Reread those glowing testimonials, grab

some sleep, reset, and get back out there with fresh energy. Start having conversati
about anything —Steve Chandler says, “Every sale happens within a conversation,”

he’s not wrong. So go chat someone up and let the magic begin. | 120 of 40 |

Scaling Clients Without Overload
The secret to building a thriving coaching business? Surprisingly simple.

Think of it like cooking. You need a balanced “menu” of clients to keep things cooki
just right. On the back burner, you have those slow-brewing corporate deals, like VF
that need 45-120 days to simmer before they’re ready. And don’t even mention 30-c
“net terms.” I’m not your loan shark—|’m just here for the actual money, thanks! On
front burner? Fast-cooking 1:1 coaching clients, who you can “close and serve” in 1
calls if the timing’s perfect. Group programs? They are excellent as a “gateway drug
but remember—the big bucks are in 1:1 customization.

Here’s a hack: say “custom” and “bespoke” at every chance. This can boost your fe
close rate, and deal speed by 10X. It’s like magic. People will pay $99 to be one of €
thousand on a call with Arnold Schwarzenegger, but they'll fork over $10,000 to spe
a day with him alone. Customization sells. Make it your mantra.

Jacco van der Koojj calls it “stackable revenue bricks.” Translation: Keep it simple.
Stack a few solid offers you can handle. | learned this the hard way. In month 6, I
juggled 40 clients—hopping on calls, building scripts and white papers, handling
RevOps, and fixing tech stacks. | was trying to be the Bo Jackson of
coaching—dominating mindset baseball, strategy football, and emotional track and
field—until | burned out so hard, it was like his bat snapped over my knee.

Even with a team, the workload was chaos. From 6 a.m. to 3 a.m., | was downing Re
Bull like water and still losing clients. Worse, it felt like “turn to page 16 for your gent
coaching plan” instead of the fun, creative 1:1 customization that makes coaching
exciting.

So, write down every service you can monetize to scale without losing your sanity. F
the top three ways you like to work. Bundle a few retainer packages, roll them out, a
stack them. My sweet spot? Working with teams of up to 10 reps for $15K/month o1
three-month minimum retainer. That’s $45K, or $36K if they pay upfront. I’ve pared

down my offerings to 1:1 coaching and team workshops since those are the easiest

stack. 121 of 140

Closing Corporate Clients— Your Cash Cow

What’s the secret sauce behind the world’s top companies? Believe it or not, up to
40% use executive coaching to stay ahead of the pack (Hay Group International). Ar
here’s the wild part—a Metrix Global study says coaching delivers a mind-blowing
788% ROI, boosting productivity, retaining top talent, and fattening the bottom line.

I'll never forget an intake call Josh Braun led with a VP and their team. He opened w
“Who here has a growth mindset and actually wants this training?” Silence. Then, th
split: growth mindset folks vs. the “I'd rather wing it” crowd. Too often, companies t:

coaching to work, you need people who want to be there. Savvy managers know thi
and pick growth-hungry, motivated reps who are just itching for that next level. That
where fundamental transformation happens.

The Bell Curve is catnip! When | chat ROI with CROs, | say, “Let’s move your middle

performers up and to the right.” Then | ask, “Tell me about your team—who’s on the

could be persuaded. It’s a numbers game, but you’ve got to play it smart.

Sometimes, the imaginative play is to team up with one person or division, help ther
crush it, and let the results bubble up the ladder.

Case in point: | closed a $300K deal because an SDR leader got my guides off Redc
three years ago. He used them to rack up 80 net new F1000 opportunities with a Ve
diagram, of all things. Leadership changed, a bid opened with three new trainers, ar
won because I'd already proven my chops. That’s what happens when you start at t
ground level—you end up owning the whole building.

Here’s an example of Aaron Norris generating a meeting with a corporate team
enablement leader.

“A referral post tag turned into a multi-threaded outreach win. | WhatsApped the
referrer, ghost-wrote a reply for them, and then connected directly with the sales lea
and enablement lead. | dove right into their goals in DMs, secured an intro to
enablement from the sales leader, and even sweetened the deal with a referral incen
to keep the original referrer engaged. Quick action, targeted engagement, and strate
incentives—transforming a tag into tangible leads!”

Corporations are just groups of individuals, so the 7-step process works just as
effectively —the only difference is longer sales cycles due to all the red tape. It’s
bureaucracy-central! My focus is on team leads with 5-15 years of experience, typic
from director level to CRO. | engage them with open-ended questions about their
team’s performance, goals, and challenges, ensuring the conversation is both releve
and insightful.

Delivery? | only hold weekly workshops and then have an executive call weekly or
bi-weekly, with unlimited access to shared Slack and asynchronous doc collaboratic
On that call, we discuss the progress of individual team members. And that’s it! |
learned this model from greats like Aaron Ross. You can’t constantly be with the clie
and their team because then they’re not selling during the golden hours.

You will often get baked off against other trainers, so the secret to winning a training
RFP like the one | just closed for $300,000 to train 600 sellers is to have a hardcore

champion evangelize for you from the inside.

| shipped my books to all the five decision-makers in this deal. | tailored my pitch or
each call. | worked with my champion on the pitch deck and presentation, even the
GANTT chart of how the rollout would happen globally. He spoke the internal love
language, and | beat out another rival trainer who charged less and had even worke:
with this SVP before. One bidder was such a JMM™ clone, it felt like a scene out of
Multiplicity—but not Michael Keaton #1, more like clone #4. The SVP’s eyebrow saic
all!

Why did | win? My open-source, flexible framework could be wrapped around their

existing McKinsey plays and tech stack, like Sales Nav, ZoomInfo, Outreach, etc. M
focus on tech-enabled systems, frameworks, and formulas brought the RevOps tea!
to the table, the glue between Sales and Marketing in an ABM approach.

into individual L&D budgets. Most provide about $1.5K per rep (per year), which is n
enough for your 1:1 premium executive coaching, but it can contribute. Remember,
you coach sales development reps (SDRs), 40% of them roll up to Marketing (per
Bridge Group).

command chain like you’re a corporate unicorn.

- New decision-maker? New cycle. When a new senior exec shows up, don’t just
dust off the same pitch. Hit the reset button and start wooing them like it’s date nigt
all over again.

Troubleshooting: Be the NFL’s Cryo-Coach, Not the Play Caller

Think of yourself as the NFL’s “strength and conditioning coach,” not the head coach
barking plays on the field. Why? Because VPs get territorial—sometimes hilariously
hostile—when they think you’re a third-party trainer swooping in to show them up. So
disarm them with humor:

“Don’t worry, John, you’re the lead coach. I’m just here to take the team into the
cryo-chamber, dunk them in the ice bath like Wim Hof, and teach them upside-down
handstand pushups and backflips.”

This instantly neutralizes their competitiveness and reframes you as the secret weapon,
not the threat. Add this gem:

“Bringing me in shows your team you’re investing in their success. Most companies
wouldn’t even consider hiring an external coach—it’s rare, and it’s powerful.”

It’s true. Across the 13 companies I’ve worked for, only two ever invested in formalized
training (Challenger and Sandler). The rest? Like a reality TV show—high drama, no
strategy. Just wing it, hope for the best and let the CRO “super close” deals with a mix
of charm and sheer panic.

Pro Tip: How to Nail Your SKO and Day Rates

Oren Klaff taught me to price Sales Kickoffs (SKOs) at $25K, with travel and hotel
included. Virtual? Drop it to $15K—because, hey, you’re not raiding the minibar. ;-) For
perspective, an infamous UK trainer charges $7K/day, Chris Caldwell makes $15K/day,
and Tony J. Hughes charges $5K/month for two “human days” (whatever that means).
Still way cheaper than hiring an FTE who needs a 401(k) and “unlimited” PTO.

Fun fact: hiring anyone in a Tier 1 city costs $100K+, even if they think “BANT” is a
kind of sandwich. Meanwhile, Caldwell raked in $144K in a week, thanks to SKOs.
Famous Training Co.? They charge $25K just to show up and say, “Believe in yourself!”
So, own your rate—it’s a steal compared to hiring someone who needs Slack tutorials
and vape breaks to survive.

The Best Rate Rebuttal Ever

If they try to haggle, drop this mic-worthy line:

"If | lower my rate, what does that teach your sales team when your prospects ask for
discounts?”

CEO: “You're right. We'll pay the full fee upfront.”

Boom. No discounts, no drama—just the respect (and rate) you deserve.

Stacking revenue isn’t about living in “implementation purgatory,” where your life
becomes an endless loop of spreadsheets and Zoom calls. The real magic happens in
the high-impact zone—where your brilliance shines, not grinds. Stick to
implementation, and you’re juggling 2-4 clients, max. Switch to strategy—getting paid
to think, not do—and suddenly scaling to 15+ clients is as easy as Friday night takeout.
As David C. Baker wisely says in The Business of Expertise, strategy and
implementation are two rooms connected by a hallway—shut the implementation door,
and you stop being just another commodity. The payoff? You scale like someone who
charges for blueprints, not just bricks.

The goal? Don’t be the “doer” buried in the trenches. Be the “sage on the
mountain” —the one people go to for big-picture magic. The less you roll up your
sleeves, the more you’re stacking revenue and scaling like a boss.

Picture this: you’re hopping on calls for $7K monthly with three clients—$21K total.
That’s nice, but you're maxed out if you’re doing all the gritty work yourself. Instead,
“shut the execution door.” Take one or two hands-on clients and then stack up on pure
advisory. Imagine it: no more heavy lifting, just high-level 1:1 strategy sessions, GTM
coaching, and sales role-plays. Hit $100K months solo? It's not wild if you layer up like
this. Call it your personal revenue “layer cake” — delicious and profitable, without
getting crumbs on your hands.

Anatomy of a $100,000 Month:

$60,000 in 1:1s

5 * 1:1 clients at 5K * 3mos, paid upfront w/ a 20% discount

(5 X 12K = 60K)

+ $36,000 in Team Workshops

1 team $15,000/mo for three months w/ a 20% discount if paid upfront. Workshops on
a proven outbound method.

($45,000 X 20%) $36,000

+ $5,000 in Intensives

1 $5K 2-hour intensive, or making a cameo on a team call to give a mini-workshop. My
record was earning $7,000 for 20 minutes of tactics for a CRM company once. ;-)

| always start with a three-month minimum because, let’s face it, in the first 30-45 days,
clients hit the Trough of Disillusionment harder than a toddler coming down from a
sugar high (hat tip Gartner Hype Cycle). That’s the danger zone where they’re
wondering why they signed up. Stick with me, though, because after that?
Boom-—Slope of Enlightenment. A one-month stint? That’s just begging for a 4/10 Yelp
review, and nobody wants that. Ninety days is where the magic happens.

Get creative with pricing. Start with a $500-$1K/week package—ideal for clients who
want success without maxing out their credit cards. Or go big with a $25K-50K
sorcerer’s apprenticeship, where you go full-on Gandalf mode, mentoring them for
6-12 months like you’re their personal wizard-in-residence. At least you’re not charging
$1MM to shout “UNLEASH YOUR POWER’ while they fry their feet on hot coals a la
Tony Robbins.

Feeling fancy? Offer a Bali retreat because, apparently, breakthroughs only happen
after $20 smoothies and a group cry by a waterfall. Not into Bali? Host it somewhere
“elevated” (read: within Uber range) where the fanciest thing is solid Wi-Fi. Prefer
something steady? Try six months of bi-weekly calls—or crank it up with 30-minute
HIIT-style coaching that’s like CrossFit for their brain. | toss them strategies and say,
“Crush it—and if anyone brings up firewalking, just smile and back away slowly.”

You can thrive on volume, too. I’ve done 275+ invoices in a year, leaving other coaches
gobsmacked. But some, like Bryan Franklin, take the “forever” model: $25K up front,
then $5K/month on autopilot, keeping clients for 2-5 years. It’s all about knowing your
Serengeti style—are you a cheetah, lion, or gazelle? Either way, anchor your fees high
from the start and act like you belong there.

Long-term positioning is key. Don’t offer a month, cross your fingers and hope they'll
upgrade. Instead, pitch 12 months, 6 months, or 3 months right out of the gate, with
discounts for paying upfront. Example: $50K for 12 months, $25K for 6 months, $12K
for 3 months. Knock off 20% if they pay upfront. Oh, and one more thing: no refunds.

If you see greatness in someone, offer monthly payments—but only if they’ve got skin
in the game. Without mutual commitment, they’ll treat your coaching like an ayahuasca
retreat—lots of deep talks and puking, but no real-life follow-through. Transformation
needs stakes, not just visions of a new you! (By the way, Lizard people are real; I’ve

reported to them.)

Finally, avoid hourly rates like they’re radioactive. Charging hourly makes it harder for
clients to justify the investment, and it cheapens your value. As Alan Weiss says, “It’s
unethical to charge by the hour because it incentivizes me to drag things out instead of
delivering results.” Translation? High-impact outcomes deserve high-impact fees. So,
ditch the clock, embrace the value, and charge like you mean it.

like a shared Google Doc masterpiece. Begin with simple headers to lock down the

Talking money over email is like trying to sell a parachute to someone over the phone

Pro-tip on nailing Commercials: Alan Weiss and my experience in charity fundraising
working for Sean Parker at Causes.com confirm The Choice of Multiple Yeses. Always
include three levels of pricing because 80% of the time, they pick the middle option.

‘Choice of Yeses’ - Alan Weiss-inspired Example:

Option 1:

1:1 coaching for your VP for 90 days = $15K (6K/mo * 3 months) or 20% off upfront
($12K)

Option 2:

Team coaching for 90 days - $45K up to 10 reps (15K/mo * 3 months) or 20% off paid
upfront ($36K)

Option 3:

Six months paid upfront = 30% off either Option 1 or 2

Get creative with pricing, but always include a "why-does-this-even-exist" low option
and a high fee so outlandish it sounds like you’re trying to fund a moon mission. Most

clients will gravitate towards the middle, feeling like financial geniuses for picking the
“Goldilocks” plan.

Now, when they try to negotiate, stay cool. If they ask, “Can you cut me a deal?” hit
them with, “Well, John, considering the ROI on just two of your deals is $100K, you’re
practically robbing me at this price.” ;-) And when Karen asks for a shorter term, fire
back with, “Look, Karen, it takes 21 days to form a habit. Neuroplasticity, baby. Let’s
go 90 days so you don’t relapse into bad LinkedIn posts.” Clients will push back, but
as Mike Bosworth says, they’re just “squeezing the towel”—so anchor high, stand firm,
and keep reminding them why they’re here: to make money, not friends.

To keep them laser-focused, tag them in a shared “proposal sketch” doc under “North
Star Goals” and make them edit it. If they add something absurd, like “5X pipeline in 90
days,” tone it down to “Work toward 5Xing pipeline in 90 days.” Under-promise and
over-deliver—that way, when you triple their pipeline instead of quintupling it, they'll
still feel like they hit the jackpot. Clear expectations prevent churn, and if you throw in
the occasional surprise 1:1, they'll think you’re a hero, not just doing your job.

Oh, and boundaries are everything. Once | capped 1:1 calls to two 30-minute slots a
week and shifted teams to workshops only, my hourly rate shot through the roof. Now,
| handle 25+ clients at a time, impacting hundreds of reps with workshops while
keeping my private clients limited to a select few getting premium “love and

support” —DMs, docs, the works. I’m like the sales coach version of John Wick—calm,
precise, and unstoppable. | don’t “implement”; | execute.

That’s why you’ve got to pick a consulting niche that feels as natural as breathing.
When you align your gifts with your talents, you'll stay in flow, cranking out brilliance
without pulling all-nighters or staring blankly at a screen. It’s like Bruce Lee’s
philosophy—be like water: adaptable, powerful, and always finding its way to flow
effortlessly around obstacles.

So, do what you love, and you'll never work another day in your life—or at least, you'll
look like you’re having fun doing it. After all, Zig Ziglar said it best: “You can have
everything you want in life if you'll just help enough other people get what they want.”

And remember, as Dale Carnegie put it: “You can make more friends in two months by
pretending to care about people than in two years of them pretending to care about
you.” Wait, is that how he said it? Close enough. ;-)

Books & Content—Creating Ultra-High Intent Leads

Adapted from Naval Ravikant, this strategy with a little Alex Hormozi beard over
muscle-shirt flavor maps out the holy grail of scaling leverage. At the start, before
you've got capital to throw around, the best leverage is content. Become a content
machine. Crank out posts, videos, blogs, and bam—you will influence status (and cash
flow). With that cash, you can invest in scalable assets like code. Eventually, you’ll have
the resources to build a team and become the business equivalent of a one-person
band with a full orchestra backing you up like Michael Bublé.

The secret weapon? Recycling and repurposing your content.

Save everything when you deliver a workshop, training, or coaching session. You're
building an arsenal of decks, videos, podcasts, and guides—a master key to unlock
new possibilities and a versatile toolkit you can customize to tackle each client’s unique
challenges. Five years in, I’ve got a treasure trove of assets—interviews, templates,
guides—you name it. Content leverage is like the sourdough starter of your business:
keep feeding it, and it’ll keep delivering value for your clients and your bottom line.

Looking back over the past five years, I’ve nailed my formula: start with
books—super-high intent magnets. Add hundreds of YouTube interviews. That combo
brought in capital, which | funneled into building teams, code, and projects like a
startup version of Sherwood Forest. Alan Weiss says, “One book is an anomaly, but
three books make you an expert.”

So | kept writing, dropping content breadcrumbs—Lars Nilsson-style ABSD
spreadsheets and Codex cheat codes—so people could track me down like | was
hiding out in the woods. Reddit banned me for “selling,” but | was just playing Robin
Hood: giving new reps techniques that generate billions in pipeline while the old
trainers are still bragging about cold calls they made on landlines during the Reagan
administration.

The trick to cranking out content? Parkinson’s Law—work expands to fit the time
available. Goals are dreams with deadlines. Want to finish a book? Set a target of
30-45K words by the end of the quarter. Get up, take your coffee, and write for an hour
or two every morning. Start with an outline, then pour it all onto the page like you’re
just talking to your clients. Writing a book doesn’t have to take years; set a date and
sprint. Done.

Do the same with YouTube. Through your content, lead fans on a “treasure hunt.” |
once found a hidden gem about “chat flows” in an episode with Ankush Jain and
emailed him immediately to send me a guide. People love a good Easter egg.

Want more? Start a Substack or Medium blog, firing off spontaneous hot takes
whenever inspiration hits. Prospects will follow your updates like a hawk (and maybe
even pay a few bucks for the privilege). I’ve even broken the news inside private
groups, dropping info like a mic, only to watch it spread like wildfire. The best leak?
The one you’ve engineered.

If you open-source your I.P., make sure credit comes with it. My work’s been
“borrowed” so much my fans police it like Banksy’s street art. With JVM™ staples like
Venn Diagrams, “thoughts?” bumps, and RRM call openers, my style is so distinct that
copycats get exposed faster than a Bachelor secret after two glasses of wine. So, will
your legacy be Milli Vanilli or Eddie Van Halen? Choose wisely.

Power of Delegation—Leveraging Subcontractors

I’ve got a squadron of virtual assistants (VAs) covering everything from data wrangling
and social media antics to YouTube stardom, B2B wizardry, and animation magic. One
of my favorite power moves? Deploying VAs to run my 4th frame strategy—like that
crew | had in Denmark, logging into my LinkedIn profile to kickstart conversations and
tee up $15K in billings. Trust me, it’s like having a secret army.

Top coaches, like lan Koniak, have leveled up by hiring a Head of Business
Development to handle outreach and prospecting—cloning yourself without cloning the
Chevy Chase dad jokes. I’ve mentored many Gen Zs under my business umbrella and
even have a 20% referral offer that attracts the bold and brilliant.

There’s the “hands-on artisan” approach—doing it all yourself, like Bond trying to
defuse a bomb while holding a martini and charming a Bond girl. Or you could hand off
bookings, chat rooms, and Kajabi to a community manager—that’s like having your
own Q, whipping up gadgets while you sip your martini, and taking all the credit for
saving the day.

Need leads? | know VAs who could find the Yeti and Jimmy Hoffa if you asked them to.
They human-verify cell numbers, write email sequences, and warm up 15+ email
addresses —all so you can scale like a legend. If you’re ready to make moves, hit me
up—lI'll hook you up with a tiger team that’s both ferocious and cost-effective.

Pro Tip: If you’re going the Upwork route, nail down a killer SOP (Standard Operating
Procedure). Spell precisely what you want in an “instructions” document, click-by-click,
with screenshots and maybe a joke or two for good measure. Trust me, it’ll save
everyone much time and make scaling less of a headache.

Cohorts & Courses—Expand Without Cannibalizing
“The more people on the call, the less you pay.” - Jamal Reimer

Always, always start high when selling services. If your VIP 1:1 package is a cool
$18,000, lead with that offer—no hesitation. From there, you can work with a small
group, a cohort, or maybe even a neighbor’s cat. But remember, every new tier means
more marketing, so only go “pyramid” if you love talking about your stuff. ;-)

Building courses isn’t a walk in the park—it’s like dating a stripper: exciting at first, but
soon you’re knee-deep in drama, late nights, and questionable decisions. And the
people ready to pay $997 for a course? They’re not the ones committing to high-ticket
programs. Coaches waste months perfecting $1K courses, only to realize they could’ve

landed a $12-25K client with way less effort and no glitter to clean up.

Here’s the deal: courses and cohorts can be cash cows. Fast revenue, baby—I| once
pulled in $25K in a few days. The catch? Saturated markets and clients saying, “I’ve
already learned everything in your course from your books,” or worse, “I’m drowning in
five other courses.” Turns out, not everyone wants to binge-watch fifty canned videos

like it’s the latest season of Project Runway. Shocking, right? Attention spans are
shorter than Trump’s list of "great people, the best people" before he fires them.

That’s where premium 1:1 options come in. Some coaches throw out black card offers,
like $12-18K packages—and guess what? The ones who want it, want it. It bridges the
gap beautifully, offering tailored 1:1 sessions at $250 to $2,000/hour. Clients get the
VIP experience without wondering, “Wait, am | making a Tesla down payment?”

Fun fact: you can’t lose a deal you never had. I’ve had clients start at $997 and later
renew for $12,000—it happens more often than you think. And just a handful of
$10K/month retainer clients? That’s $30K a month or $360K a year. A few solid yeses,
and you’re laughing all the way to the bank.

That’s the funny thing about this racket—it’s like The Hangover. One yes, and you're
partying in the penthouse with a tiger in the bathroom. One no, and you’re waking up
on the roof with no pants and a splitting headache.

On your way to $25K/month, think like Danny Ocean: smooth, sharp, and one step
ahead. Anchor high, lock in premium 1:1 clients and snag a few team packages.
Building the “perfect course” or running ads? That’s betting it all on red and hoping
Terry Benedict doesn’t have cameras. Ads cost $150 per lead, and refunds? Yeah,
right.

| once watched a startup burn $1MM on ads. The big score? One sad box of cupcakes
from the agency. No cash, no jewels—just frosting and existential regret. Play it smart,
keep it lean, and walk out like you cracked the Bellagio vault—because telling
disappointed clients, “You shook Sinatra’s hand,” won’t save the day.

Conclusion: Do the Opposite—Wisdom from Nightingale &
Costanza

Whatever you've been told, whatever rule you've heard about “how to succeed” —flip it
on its head. Earl Nightingale was right: if everyone’s rushing one way, the real treasure
is probably stashed in the opposite direction. You’re here because you're ready to ditch
the predictable, the same ol' sales scripts and “proven frameworks” and instead dive

into the uncharted. After all, empires, fortunes, and dynasties weren’t built by following
the crowd. They were built by visionaries who took wild leaps and backed them up with
guts.

Client acquisition, my friend, is older than pyramids. Fire-for-food old. Back then, if you
had a fire, people listened. Fast forward to now, and we’re flooded with all these
so-called “growth hacks” and “guaranteed formulas.” Well, I’m here to strip away the
fluff, hand you a playbook, and remind you that creating clients is more straightforward
than all the smoke and mirrors suggest. It’s about listening, genuine curiosity, and,
believe it or not, letting silence do the heavy lifting.

Listen, Jonny Staker, one of my clients, nailed it. After closing a $12K deal, another
coach asked him, “What's your secret?” And he replied, “I didn’t talk.” It wasn’t the
PowerPoint deck; it wasn’t the razzle-dazzle. It was good old-fashioned listening.
Silence? That’s the undercover power play right there.

if you're here thinking, “But this space is too crowded!” let me tell you something:
there’s room for you. When | shifted my focus from profit to purpose, stopped
performing, and started connecting, it was like the universe handed me a set of X-ray
glasses. | could see what others missed. | want this Matrix vision for you. | want you to
feel what it’s like when clients choose you because, for once, they feel seen.

Five years ago, | was grinding, getting by, questioning everything. Today, I’ve built a
globally recognized business, and I’m here telling you it’s not just possible—it’s
inevitable if you want it badly enough. | want you to feel the thrill of hitting your first
$25K month, buying that house, writing that book, and whatever wild dreams you’ve
stashed away. This is about unleashing your full potential—the kind of big, bold moves
that make you pause and say, “Wait... is this really my life?”

And let’s be honest: statistically, | shouldn’t be here. | should’ve been knocked off
course long ago. But here | am, urging you to trust the words in these pages, the
process, the systems, and—most importantly—yourself. When a client recently asked,
“Does this stuff work?” | just said, “Trust me.” And guess what? He closed his first $3K
deal by breakfast the next day. That’s the power of this.

The legends of my journey—my first VP of Sales, Jim Thoeni, Steve Hardison, “The
Ultimate Coach” —all left me with these mantras | now pass on to you. Jim’s was

simple but potent: KTFB—Keep The Fire Burning. Let that fire guide you when the road
is steep, rejection stings, and you're tempted to pack it in.

And as Steve Hardison always says at the end of everything: Loving you. So | say it to
you now—thank you for letting me be part of this wild ride. Go out there and make
magic, Mav.

Oh, and if you’re ever in doubt? Take it from Jerry Seinfeld and George Costanza:

Jerry: If every instinct you have is wrong, then the opposite would have to be
right.

George: Yes, | will do the opposite!

So, do the opposite. Do something. Do everything. And then get ready to watch your
life explode into everything you ever wanted.

Vaya con dios!

Thank yous:

Huge thanks to Charles Needham—RevOps wizard, rising star, and certified typo
hitman—for saving this book from becoming a “flat” grammar crime scene. And to
Mendy Zimmerman, sales polymath, and wisdom dealer, your edits on 3.0 and 4.0
were so sharp they should come with a warning label. Honestly, this book would’ve
been a dumpster fire with a glossary without you two. Grateful doesn’t even begin to
cover it!
